189,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608330467570,a 7 page
190,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608330476317,essay on Brexit and the consequences it'll have on BRitish politics
191,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608330483372,and how the United Kingdom will now likely unravel
192,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608330487249,FACTS YO i forgot
193,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608330493016,chernobyl was so fucking good
194,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608330520773,in like ratings wise it's def top 3 for me but like i'm not as attached to the characters bc it's only 5 or 6 episodes so in that regard it's not in my top 3
195,Hursh Karkhanis,1608331124621,Wait can you explain it idk anything about that
196,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608331262886,"basically united kingdom is pretty much as conservative as the us, and the main issues for them was immigration bc EU promoted easy immigration, and the older ppl of england were like nah we want to âpreserve our traditionsâ and shit liek thar"
197,Hursh Karkhanis,1608331286139,ohhh gotcha
198,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608331290955,brexit passed w a 52% majority and it was mainly bc 90% of ppl 65 and older voted to leave the eu
199,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608331296326,and rhe uneducated
200,Hursh Karkhanis,1608331311403,That sucks
201,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608331314250,"90% voted, but a big majority was to leave**"
202,Hursh Karkhanis,1608331836888,ohh gotcha
203,Hursh Karkhanis,1608331881125,So UK isnât gonna be part of the EU that means they arenât gonna be part of the trade/currency exchange/immigration âstuffâ that the rest of the EU is part of?
204,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608331915393,Yeah they had their own currency already
205,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608331946792,and theyâre working to keep the same trade policies going but itâs kinda cherrypicking and thats now how it works
206,Hursh Karkhanis,1608332200022,damn
207,Hursh Karkhanis,1608332212817,so this was initially voted on in 2016 and is being implemented now?
208,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608332225732,yeah took a few years to get shit in order
209,Hursh Karkhanis,1608332227007,bc i rememeber there was lots of news about that in summer '16
210,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608332230035,mhm
211,Hursh Karkhanis,1608332250896,so im sure boris johnson is happy bc hes a conservative right?
212,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608332268270,also like scotland and northern ireland voted to stay by like overwhelming majority but since their population is only like 8 million combined vs englandâs 55 their votes didnt matter as much
213,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608332276906,yep
214,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608332297334,david cameron was the one who initiated it

217,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608340317387,I passed by -0.47% bc he rounded up bless his soul

331,Hursh Karkhanis,1608418432928,hella interesting stories
332,Faizan Khan,1608419818847,kobe sounds like he was like
333,Faizan Khan,1608419844336,obsessed with his craft to a borderline unhealthy amount
334,Alex Duong,1608419871023,workaholic
335,Faizan Khan,1608419973280,i feel like as he got older post shaq years he turned that energy into kind of a more of a mature style
336,Faizan Khan,1608419983756,early years he was just like young guy filled with energy gtfo my way im gonna win or throw hands
337,Faizan Khan,1608420013008,i wish i got to watch him early years too tbh
338,Rishi Nair,1608420039466,That's how he got from multiple airballs vs Jazz to stone cold killa
339,Faizan Khan,1608420044639,and the end oft he video where he says like he always had that soft side hidden that we all got to see towards the end ð¥º
340,Faizan Khan,1608420130956,also lol its crazy how bad he always says shaq's work ethic was bc the dude became a top 5/6 all time player WITH that work ethic
341,Faizan Khan,1608420140587,how fucking good would shaq have been w/ a better work ethic
342,Faizan Khan,1608420142814,prob goat
343,Rishi Nair,1608420151197,P likely goat
344,Rishi Nair,1608420162273,Easily goat C
345,Rishi Nair,1608420182663,Imagine Shaq w a J
346,Rishi Nair,1608420192364,He could already pass p well
347,Alex Duong,1608420195511,i went from like a kobe hater in middle school
348,Alex Duong,1608420204923,to really appreciating him once he retired
349,Faizan Khan,1608420451055,yeah shaq's game aged rlly bad
350,Faizan Khan,1608420460246,his decline literally started at 30/31
351,Hursh Karkhanis,1608420503720,He was. People donât like to admit it bc they love him and obv heâs dead now but thatâs the truth
352,Hursh Karkhanis,1608420520372,it was his best and also worst trait
353,Faizan Khan,1608420542802,yeah i mean its the same energy it was just channeled better as he became older i think
354,Faizan Khan,1608420553409,when ur young and obsessive ur gonna be kinda diva
355,Hursh Karkhanis,1608420595920,Yeah when he was older he was able to separate it more. He was a killer on the court but friendly to teammates off the court. Made that realization in 2008-2009
356,Hursh Karkhanis,1608420616068,Where as young Kobe was a killer on the court but aloof and a loner off the court
357,Hursh Karkhanis,1608420629746,"Didnât hang with teammates or anything, thatâs why people liked Shaq better"
358,Faizan Khan,1608420648058,also ik this is obvious but its literally insane sometimes how identical he was to jordan
359,Faizan Khan,1608420651383,in terms of every little thing
360,Faizan Khan,1608420677124,the only difference i think was post retirement cuz jordan just kidna faded and ran his business and kobe became super involved with the community
361,Hursh Karkhanis,1608420678532,Then he realized in 2008-2009 he couldnât just be a leader by being a leader on the court he had to âmassageâ the social relationship too so he started taking his teammates to dinner and paying for them and stuff like that
362,Hursh Karkhanis,1608420708455,Yeah bc Kobe himself was obsessed with Jordan he was like his guru LOL
363,Hursh Karkhanis,1608420719482,Or like a Prophet
364,Faizan Khan,1608420750532,This is prob a stretch but somehow they even sound similar when talking LOL
365,Hursh Karkhanis,1608420762338,Thatâs not a stretch at all
366,Hursh Karkhanis,1608420778404,Kobe purposely used to emulate Jordanâs like mouth movements when he was young
367,Hursh Karkhanis,1608420787755,Like imitating how he talked and stuff
368,Faizan Khan,1608420788553,Really???
369,Hursh Karkhanis,1608420798254,Ya bruh Itâs documented and verified

441,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608452940208,Cheeks archibald idk
442,Rishi Nair,1608452943119,Lillard is already greater lol
443,Rishi Nair,1608452954714,And despite MVP
444,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608452963647,Ywah lillard i agree w
445,Rishi Nair,1608452966341,Idt Westie much greater than Dame if at all
446,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608452989928,The thing is
447,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608452999132,Rondo is better than a lot of these guys postseason wisd lol
448,Rishi Nair,1608453019960,Billups idk
449,Rishi Nair,1608453022808,Kyrie idts
450,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608453031758,Like Westbrook is way better than rondo reg season but
451,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608453042083,Playoff rondo imo >> playoff Westbrook
452,Rishi Nair,1608453044331,Cheeks and Archibald should be greater
453,Rishi Nair,1608453063110,Playoff Ameya>Playoff Westbrook
454,Rishi Nair,1608453222738,LMAO Vishal
455,Alex Duong,1608453278933,why are private convos being leaked lol
456,Alex Duong,1608453420145,also jerry west ended on bad terms with the jerry buss family prob still holds some grudge
457,Rishi Nair,1608453555897,Lmao honestly idk why he'd say that about Lakers
458,Rishi Nair,1608453562461,I've had a high opinion of him
459,Rishi Nair,1608453581250,Lakers were neither really great nor shit show
460,Alex Duong,1608453584641,vishal satish??
461,Rishi Nair,1608453591880,And now Clips p much a shit show
462,Rishi Nair,1608453604634,Naw this another Vishal
463,Faizan Khan,1608454926682,Nah bruh no way
464,Faizan Khan,1608455058809,Dame and Kyrie should both be over but let them do it a bit longer
465,Faizan Khan,1608455066510,Dame might be already
466,Faizan Khan,1608455101261,Billups had crazy longevity
467,Faizan Khan,1608455118137,And peak I donât think was far off if at all from Rondo
468,Rishi Nair,1608455168614,Thing is billups peak was 18 and 8
469,Rishi Nair,1608455179742,He did hit big shots tho
470,Faizan Khan,1608455359058,what was rondo's
471,Faizan Khan,1608455371112,like 13 and 11
472,Rishi Nair,1608455433161,Plus steals but yea
473,Rishi Nair,1608455453684,I think Rondo was better/much better than his numbers tho
474,Faizan Khan,1608455478006,also rondo was like sneaky nice both of his rings but billups had a bigger part in his ring than either of rondo's
475,Faizan Khan,1608455500879,like rondo's prime was in between the 2 rings
476,Faizan Khan,1608455616492,first one he was upstart young dude 5th best player on his team 2nd one he was coming off the bench
477,Rishi Nair,1608455711847,2nd ring he was a role player
478,Rishi Nair,1608455717147,Super role player maybe
479,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608456268539,@Faizan Khan
480,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608456284642,Other than scoring rondos better at everything lol
481,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608456319387,And billups was the primary scorer on the GOAT defensive team
482,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608456479243,Rondos only 3 seasons less
483,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608456518740,Nobodys arguing rondo over dame
484,Rishi Nair,1608456531112,Funny thing is both have mad longevity but p relatively unimpressive peaks
485,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608456572721,I dont think kyrie deserves to be unless he wins another ring/an MVP
486,Rishi Nair,1608456576101,We been spoiled by Dame Russ Rose etc peaks
487,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608456611894,And w billups i think its arguable but i think theres a better case for rondo
488,Rishi Nair,1608456639150,More fans would prob say Rondo but also bc Chauncey was underrated
489,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608456678948,He was similar ro rondo bc they both were high iq leaders
490,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608456686642,And tenacious defenders
491,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608456701353,And transitioned well as tjey aged
492,Rishi Nair,1608457054950,Chimezie Metu> both these bums
493,Faizan Khan,1608457255571,thing is tho billups was in his prime for all those like 12/13 years
494,Faizan Khan,1608457259982,or at least 10-12 of those
495,Faizan Khan,1608457267735,rondo's been out of his prime for a bit now
496,Faizan Khan,1608457285377,like he's still effective come playoff time but idt this is his prime
497,Faizan Khan,1608457310383,prime was like 2009-2014 i think
498,Rishi Nair,1608457423464,He had a nice little resurgence in Sac tho
499,Rishi Nair,1608458148771,Kings fr had Rondo Rudy Gay and Boogie and only won 32 games
500,Rishi Nair,1608458162889,Literally won 33 the next year w no Rondo no Gay
501,Rishi Nair,1608458188504,Had Gay actually nvm
502,Rishi Nair,1608458193510,Added Tyreke too
503,Alex Duong,1608458214115,They were on the right track with mike malone as their coach
504,Alex Duong,1608458221251,Then vivek fired him
505,Rishi Nair,1608458227986,Joerger*
506,Alex Duong,1608458237360,Joeger was good too
507,Rishi Nair,1608458247508,Mike Malone was never there
508,Rishi Nair,1608458257092,He's been Denver
509,Rishi Nair,1608458272763,Hold on wtf
510,Rishi Nair,1608458277869,Sac for 2 years
511,Rishi Nair,1608458278978,Nvm
512,Alex Duong,1608458279448,2013-2014 malone was there
513,Alex Duong,1608458282126,Yee
514,Alex Duong,1608458304865,Tldr: if youre a good coach vivek fires you
515,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608458402468,Man needs to give the team to rishi

533,Rishi Nair,1608504806330,Should've gotten like 35 tops
534,Hursh Karkhanis,1608504999953,You created a poll: Giannis will win a ring in _____.
535,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608505018902,"rishabh FUCKING swankar voted for ""âhis 20sâ"" in the poll."
536,Hursh Karkhanis,1608505019397,Thought it was an interesting question based on this pod I was listening to yday
537,Hursh Karkhanis,1608505029718,"You voted for ""âhis 30sâ"" in the poll."
538,Alex Duong,1608505036528,"medical guy alex voted for ""âhis 30sâ"" in the poll."
539,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608505042790,I think he'll win a ring in the next 5 years lol
540,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608505049925,Hes only 25
541,Hursh Karkhanis,1608505268567,"Thatâs why I think he will play out the rest of his 20s in MIL, get PAID, then go to a contender and take less money to win a ring when heâs like 30 or whatever"
542,Faizan Khan,1608506124845,I think they donât rlly negotiate these itâs just like whatever the max or supermax is
543,Faizan Khan,1608506131435,And gonert is a max player
544,Alex Duong,1608506164460,i mean gobert is solid but

603,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526133914,ya
604,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526141983,i went to HSS as a kid
605,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526150007,but none of the kids liked it
606,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526164124,but the ones that did were like SUPERRRRR indianized (and still are)
607,Alex Duong,1608526218524,my parents almost put me into vietnamese school
608,Alex Duong,1608526225778,then decided not too
609,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526229672,is it religious or just language
610,Alex Duong,1608526251125,language
611,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526260453,nice
612,Alex Duong,1608526264088,i think there are some that are like vietnamese catholic
613,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526271535,ohh gotcha
614,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526287221,"HSS was religious, total hinduism"
615,Alex Duong,1608526290266,since a handful of viets are catholic (effects of french imperialism)
616,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526302968,ahh didnt know that
617,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526308612,does your fam practice
618,Alex Duong,1608526313175,nope
619,Alex Duong,1608526318687,mom was muslim
620,Alex Duong,1608526327390,stopped practicing when she left iran
621,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526337182,ohh okay
622,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526383102,HSS was like to teach kids who grew up in america Hindu culture and prayers and stuff
623,Alex Duong,1608526413966,interesting
624,Alex Duong,1608526425115,and why did most kids hate it
625,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526458492,well lemme rephrase actually
626,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526492312,most kids actually didnt hate it but the kids i identified with most hated it (bc i myself hated it)
627,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526551011,"the kids who liked it were and still are hyper indianized and and the kids that didnt are like ""we like with american culture more than indian"""
628,Alex Duong,1608526561129,makes sense
629,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526575524,like i was thinking about it
630,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526584580,most of the parents we know from HSS are trumpers
631,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526598740,bc they think of things more from the point of view of india than america
632,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526608561,despite living and earning and being in america
633,Hursh Karkhanis,1608526636609,where as most non HSS parents tend to be more americanized and they liked biden better
634,Hursh Karkhanis,1608527199318,what a fucking SHOT
635,Alex Duong,1608527377643,i wanna go to ny

641,Hursh Karkhanis,1608527480455,"ya frontline workers are 1000% the priority, then prob all old people"
642,Hursh Karkhanis,1608527503645,"all essential workers too, police officers, firefighters, people like that"

644,Faizan Khan,1608529805062,@Shripad Bangaru need thoughts
645,Alex Duong,1608529885283,we dont need harden
646,Rishi Nair,1608529981975,Cs have two great young cornerstones who play the game the right way and then Kemba too
647,Rishi Nair,1608529982397,No way they should let aidsketball around them
648,Faizan Khan,1608530006959,Lmfao I didnât even see the Celtics part
649,Faizan Khan,1608530016332,Yeah celtics would be rlly dumb
650,Faizan Khan,1608530044768,Raptors could be good tho I think theyâre on the way down rn
651,Faizan Khan,1608530125011,Also this whole style thing I think is yet to be seen. Like when ppl say âhardenâs iso styleâ that is prob more him being the designated ball handler dâantoniâs system
652,Faizan Khan,1608530138163,Itâs more of a DâAntoni thing than harden thing I think basically
653,Faizan Khan,1608530162070,Like even pre DâAntoni in Houston Harden I donât think was run like that
654,Rishi Nair,1608530246669,Either this or a mix of both
655,Faizan Khan,1608530343519,Yeah i wanted to see that this season
656,Faizan Khan,1608530357004,Without DâAntoni and with a real pg
657,Shripad Bangaru,1608530659437,Raptors make sense
658,Shripad Bangaru,1608530664436,But i dont want it
659,Alex Duong,1608530876214,I really liked that movie
660,Rishi Nair,1608530991634,One of the best ever

1461,Rishi Nair,1608768468872,Actually a v underrated difference
1462,Rishi Nair,1608768489133,You'd see it when you don't have it w a shit coach i.e. Luke
1463,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608768550305,fr
1464,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608768555461,deserves all his praisw

1468,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608768746619,LOOK WHO POPPED UP IN RECOMMENDED
1469,Hursh Karkhanis,1608769009989,HAHAHA
1470,Hursh Karkhanis,1608769035145,tech big dogs all handing each other information
1471,Hursh Karkhanis,1608769071875,i wonder what the actual pipeline is between you talking about something on platform X and it popping up on platform Y
1472,Rishi Nair,1608769111568,DENIGOD
1473,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608769206101,nah i was just watching mumbai street dood vids yday sothey probably recced
1474,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608769216840,bc i have blockers for cookies
1475,Hursh Karkhanis,1608769234916,ahh blassic vibes
1476,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608769252036,mumbai street food is goated
1477,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608769267156,could eat it all day
1478,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608769281126,but we never went to juhu beach for all the vendors there ð­
1479,Faizan Khan,1608769343661,nba should have like a redzone equivalent
1480,Faizan Khan,1608769353531,jk that wouldn't really make sense
1481,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608769375235,nba needs to make the team that doesnât follow covid protocols forfeit a game instead of delaying it
1482,Hursh Karkhanis,1608769375824,"yeah bc theres no such thing as ""being close to scoring"""
1483,Faizan Khan,1608769391074,maybe like a split screen thing
1484,Hursh Karkhanis,1608769403254,"id be down for like a redzone where they only show your fantasy players though, like you can plug in which players you have"
1485,Rishi Nair,1608769406231,Frfrfrfrfrfrrrrr
1486,Hursh Karkhanis,1608769410970,but even thats better suited for football
1487,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608769434632,"bc now it effects their playoff chances so its an actual incentive to stay healthy and follow guidelines 
and for lower down teams they cna sneak in if a playoff lock isnât responsible"
1488,Faizan Khan,1608769444500,ah.....
1489,Faizan Khan,1608769447247,mr. goodell disagrees
1490,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608769450239,how would this work
1491,Faizan Khan,1608769456269,lets see how adam silver feels
1492,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608769470455,silver >>> goodell
1493,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608769480178,hot take XD
1494,Hursh Karkhanis,1608769548935,for football: like theres database of all the players and you can check off the players you have on your fantasy team and then hit ENTER and it will automatically cycle thru games where your player is on the field and prioritize it by field position
1495,Faizan Khan,1608769570549,silver is like amazing at covid/dealing with social issues/technical stuff
1496,Hursh Karkhanis,1608769585849,"like if i have adam theilen and todd gurley but if the vikings are in the red zone and the falcons are not, itll show the vikings game bc that has a higher chance of my player scoring"
1497,Faizan Khan,1608769591311,but i think he's too leniant with players like contracts straight up dont matter anymore
1498,Faizan Khan,1608769599260,goodell single biggest L is his punishments
1499,Faizan Khan,1608769603610,they make zero sense
1500,Hursh Karkhanis,1608769607979,what do you mean
1501,Faizan Khan,1608769613169,otherwise i like him
1502,Faizan Khan,1608769690658,like too much player freedom he's set a tone where they can literally do whatever and that kinda waters down the product sometimes
1503,Faizan Khan,1608769718490,any nba star can go anywhere they want at any given time with anyone these days regardless of any contract they signed
1504,Hursh Karkhanis,1608769740196,isnt that better for fans though? bc they get like the novelty of a player on a new team
1505,Hursh Karkhanis,1608769755789,which obv means more eyeballs which means more rupees
1506,Faizan Khan,1608769774498,its less parity though
1507,Faizan Khan,1608769785089,but i guess thats one perspective too yeah
1508,Hursh Karkhanis,1608769785759,ahhhh
1509,Hursh Karkhanis,1608769797046,u must have seen colins videos on parity right?
1510,Hursh Karkhanis,1608769802621,hes totally anti parity HAHA
1511,Faizan Khan,1608769849860,yeah i dont agree with him LOL
1512,Hursh Karkhanis,1608769901490,my view is that if you arent a big market team you can still be good you dont need a free agent every time. you can build up thru the draft and then the free agent can be just the final piece in the puzzle
1513,Hursh Karkhanis,1608770017937,"perfect example: Heat
less perfect example: Warriors"
1514,Faizan Khan,1608770045961,thats true but its still harder
1515,Faizan Khan,1608770053203,also warriors and heat are big markets
1516,Faizan Khan,1608770072779,but also warriors built the right way it just doesnt seem like that once kd joined
1517,Rishi Nair,1608770108509,We were the epitome of building the right way
1518,Hursh Karkhanis,1608770160014,"warriors arent really a big market by default, they became one bc of their success"
1519,Hursh Karkhanis,1608770164315,exactly
1520,Rishi Nair,1608770184552,When we were ass we def had no such benefits
1521,Hursh Karkhanis,1608770186780,LA NY CHI and MIA are the only big NBA markets IMO
1522,Hursh Karkhanis,1608770198893,like default big markets
1523,Rishi Nair,1608770203630,Dallas kind of is
1524,Hursh Karkhanis,1608770210395,yeah kinda
1525,Faizan Khan,1608770211783,im pretty sure warriors are dude
1526,Rishi Nair,1608770215264,Owner and shit
1527,Faizan Khan,1608770218023,its just right before they sucked
1528,Rishi Nair,1608770219978,Philly also
1529,Rishi Nair,1608770222014,Should be
1530,Rishi Nair,1608770225790,Any big city basically
1531,Hursh Karkhanis,1608770226996,they are a big market NOW
1532,Hursh Karkhanis,1608770239063,they were not a big market pre 2015
1533,Faizan Khan,1608770249235,they were the raiders basically
1534,Hursh Karkhanis,1608770267681,yeah they were jsut a team from somewhere in california
1535,Faizan Khan,1608770268783,still a relatively big brand who had been forgotten about bc of sucking
1536,Hursh Karkhanis,1608770334484,they wernt popular before 2015 bruh
1537,Hursh Karkhanis,1608770348505,they werrnt NATIONALLY popular ** i mean
1538,Hursh Karkhanis,1608770356417,they were always locally popular of course
1539,Hursh Karkhanis,1608770629605,"warriors did it perfectly, they built thru the draft and their reward was kevin durant"
1540,Hursh Karkhanis,1608770653095,"heat did it perfectly, built thru the draft and their reward was Butler"
1541,Hursh Karkhanis,1608770679268,"even the nets: built thru draft and trades, and their reward was KD and Media Guy"
1542,Rishi Nair,1608770680114,We must've been popular in 70d/80s when we were nice
1543,Rishi Nair,1608770683287,60s idc about
1544,Rishi Nair,1608770687948,Philadelphia Warriors
1545,Hursh Karkhanis,1608771960953,this is why these conversations about money and investments and stuff are important
1546,Rishi Nair,1608772044812,Lavar
1547,Hursh Karkhanis,1608772079892,lavar ball is a hindu bruh
1548,Hursh Karkhanis,1608772096501,...bc i know a lot of the players drafter in the 90s go broke
1549,Hursh Karkhanis,1608772139510,so im glad players who got drafted in the 2000s acted differently with their money and now we seeing players in drafted in the 2010s to get the message
1550,Hursh Karkhanis,1608772271973,but then i see daal hindu shit like this :(

1814,Rishi Nair,1609116079874,Dray is like one of the perfect guys to mentor JDubs and make sure he's not soft
1815,Faizan Khan,1609116123148,I got the notification for Embiid being out after the game started..
1816,Faizan Khan,1609116128682,And I started him

1819,Faizan Khan,1609117835745,Thoughts on this
1820,Faizan Khan,1609117854452,Itâs actually reasonable and not just blind hating to be fair
1821,Faizan Khan,1609117901333,And I would say it is partly true
1822,Faizan Khan,1609117926781,Iâd want steph on a great team WAY more than id want him on a team with nobodies
1823,Faizan Khan,1609117933479,"But also let the season play out, Iâm sure he can get them to at least .500"
1824,Faizan Khan,1609117957137,He did also take some good not great teams to relevance before 2015ish people forget that part
1825,Faizan Khan,1609118414765,"And even if it is true hypothetically  like you would want someone like durant harden even westbrook if u have a garbage team instead of steph that doesnât take away from his legacy that much bc the other way is also true, his style and flow are perfect for when u have good/shooting teams and none of those other guys would have the same success heâs had on THOSE teams"
1826,Rishi Nair,1609118503240,Partly yea but I think if Kerr actually let him run more high P&R he'd be able to

1829,Faizan Khan,1609119769174,I forgot who it was but some comedian was like he looks like heâs jerking off 2 dicks at the same time whenever he does that
1830,Faizan Khan,1609119773703,Canât unsee that
1831,Rishi Nair,1609121019334,There's a gif of that too
1832,Hursh Karkhanis,1609121091875,"the thing is, IMO trump was like a 'loveable asshole' before he got into this running for president stuff"
1833,Hursh Karkhanis,1609121119025,like he was a rich sleazebag who you just casually chuckled at bc hes so brash and confident and rich
1834,Hursh Karkhanis,1609121130985,but when he got into the presidency stuff it stopped being funny
1835,Hursh Karkhanis,1609121536659,i wonder what the reaction will be when he died

2250,Faizan Khan,1609293793477,kuz at this point is what he is he's someone who can ball when he has a featured role and the ball a lot but is useless when he's forced to be a role player
2251,Faizan Khan,1609293848817,that makes him both undervalued by people who ignore what he can do (@Rishi Nair and half of twitter) but also it's on him like you should still make the best of your role on limited minutes and points thats part of being a good player

2502,Rishi Nair,1609358040471,5.3 assists to 0.8 turnovers is just insane
2503,Rishi Nair,1609358046956,For anybody let alone a rookie
2504,Rishi Nair,1609358098548,He's making 2 threes a game on 50% 3P on top of that and    .560 FG
2505,Rishi Nair,1609358130542,Getting as many steals as turnovers
2506,Hursh Karkhanis,1609358345146,Oh shit I gotta replace Ja

2513,Hursh Karkhanis,1609358938480,Well itâs really early so everyoneâs numbers are super inflated/deflated
2514,Rishi Nair,1609359032960,Yea I can see him averaging like 8+apg to 2topg in prime tho
2515,Rishi Nair,1609359037848,He doesn't make mistakes

2519,Rishi Nair,1609359063928,They cover up his light deficiencies atm
2520,Rishi Nair,1609359089817,So like he doesn't have to run high P&R nonstop like if he went to the Knicks
2521,Rishi Nair,1609359106082,So far him and Fox fit beautifully

2809,Faizan Khan,1609548567124,Yeah honestly theyâre neck and neck but Iâd prob put Harden over him now
2810,Faizan Khan,1609548584030,^AI not curry LOL
2811,Faizan Khan,1609548647071,Harden the better reg season player and playoffs yes AI did take them to a finals but Harden took to 3 wcfs which equals or surpasses that
2812,Faizan Khan,1609548710438,And carrying a worse team and consistently running into the best team In History prob equals out
2813,Faizan Khan,1609548763915,"AI was 1 Finals and no other ECF appearances, Harden 0 finals 3 WCF appearances"
2814,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609550346185,Wait
2815,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609550351072,Did you just say
2816,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609550360357,AI had a better team than harden
2817,Faizan Khan,1609550388425,No lol
2818,Faizan Khan,1609550429842,Iâm saying the fact that AI had a worse team and the fact that Harden was in a conference with the greatest team ever and kept running into them equals out
2819,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609550616174,Eh
2820,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609550632652,I feel like the margin btwn hardens teams and AIs team is really big
2821,Faizan Khan,1609550888731,Thatâs true but no one not even MJ in hardenâs place is winning titles over KD/Steph warriors
2822,Faizan Khan,1609550895478,So like theyâre both handicapped in diff ways
2823,Faizan Khan,1609550907487,One with a bad team one with the existence of the warriors

3139,Faizan Khan,1609733063299,It was way over exaggerated how he was âstrugglingâ
3140,Faizan Khan,1609733082983,Mfs just wanna see him fail
3141,Rishi Nair,1609733084815,Teammates were bums

3143,Rishi Nair,1609733186669,I need him to get 70 this year
3144,Rishi Nair,1609733197959,He could've gotten 80 a long time ago
3145,Rishi Nair,1609733201780,Klay as well
3146,Ameya Pandit,1609733342524,Wait pause
3147,Ameya Pandit,1609733344993,Steph curry

3150,Ameya Pandit,1609733373163,Skyfucker heard heâs overrated and said ight bet
3151,Ameya Pandit,1609733380620,Dame is nice but please
3152,Rishi Nair,1609733382013,Never won anything without Dray Klay was prob the dumbest thing I heard
3153,Rishi Nair,1609733492406,I missed the hype that comes w one of the splash bros going off
3154,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609733946823,steph is top 4
3155,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609733971452,only players you can say areabove him are lebron kawhi and MAYBE kd
3156,Rishi Nair,1609734114983,I'd honestly take KD over Kawhi rn
3157,Hursh Karkhanis,1609740685406,You changed the group photo.
3158,Faizan Khan,1609740708338,I feel like heâs gonna drop more sometime this season
3159,Faizan Khan,1609740722853,Like 70/75+
3160,Faizan Khan,1609740743475,Bc heâs gotten that level of hot before several times itâs just the team is winning by so much that Kerr takes him out
3161,Faizan Khan,1609740764521,Now his team isnât as good so theyll need him to keep going
3162,Hursh Karkhanis,1609740778118,Ya good point he prob can
3163,Rishi Nair,1609742579974,Dude now he can't sit out 4th quarters anymore
3164,Rishi Nair,1609742587910,Should prolly average at least 32
3165,Rishi Nair,1609742597994,I wanna see 35 highkey

3168,Shripad Bangaru,1609746337950,"This wasnt even a steph super hot game, imagine if heâs really feeling it from three"
3169,Rishi Nair,1609746349424,80 coming this year
3170,Rishi Nair,1609746352788,I can lowkey feel it
3171,Rishi Nair,1609746367690,I love the way JTA expresses himself/talks
3172,Rishi Nair,1609746369878,It's unique
3173,Faizan Khan,1609746671937,More than anything I just really hope he makes the playoffs
3174,Faizan Khan,1609746674380,With this squad
3175,Faizan Khan,1609746685233,That would shut up the notion that he canât carry bad teams
3176,Faizan Khan,1609746692133,Which he hasnât been able to show yet
3177,Faizan Khan,1609746698079,This is the chance
3178,Rishi Nair,1609746721843,Not even like he's had absolutely no chance to show it
3179,Rishi Nair,1609746729452,He carried vs Nuggs in '13
3180,Rishi Nair,1609746734740,W only Lee
3181,Faizan Khan,1609746767592,Klay was still there though not in prime but yeah
3182,Faizan Khan,1609746774828,Wasnt a great team around him by any means
3183,Rishi Nair,1609746906735,He was injured that series
3184,Rishi Nair,1609746917276,Either injured or nowhere near close to prime
3185,Faizan Khan,1609746954745,I think he played?
3186,Faizan Khan,1609746969166,Yeah it was his 2nd or 3rd season so nowhere close to prime
3187,Rishi Nair,1609746999207,Damn wtf
3188,Rishi Nair,1609747006292,I swear I thought it was just DLee
3189,Rishi Nair,1609747011237,Averaged 15 too nb
3190,Rishi Nair,1609747031912,Barnes 14.8 Klay 14.7
3191,Rishi Nair,1609747040443,Barnes better fr
3192,Rishi Nair,1609747066686,Oh J Jack was hooping wtf
3193,Rishi Nair,1609747077044,18.8 5.2 7.0
3194,Faizan Khan,1609747099410,I think Barnes had as much or more promise as Klay at one point
3195,Rishi Nair,1609747108759,Def
3196,Rishi Nair,1609747115734,He was supposed to be more complete
3197,Faizan Khan,1609747117230,Then he ruined the league
3198,Rishi Nair,1609747125057,In HS he was supposed to be the next Kobe
3199,Rishi Nair,1609747147477,Then did ok at UNC and drafted 7th too
3200,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609747210698,disrespect
3201,Rishi Nair,1609747230161,Lotta people said it back then
3202,Rishi Nair,1609747255226,He did 9 APs lmao damn
3203,Rishi Nair,1609747266495,Iowa tho so cake
3204,Faizan Khan,1609747334149,But this team perception wise would be more like a âcarryâ
3205,Rishi Nair,1609747364098,Easily
3206,Faizan Khan,1609747364601,That team at least he like grew up with kinda thing
3207,Faizan Khan,1609747380814,Yeah I remmeber hearing Barnes hype a lot
3208,Rishi Nair,1609747384607,I think OJ Mayo was more hyped tho
3209,Faizan Khan,1609747386072,On local radio/tv
3210,Rishi Nair,1609747441193,Lmao jesus they went absolutely in on him
3211,Rishi Nair,1609747530276,Thing is that draft was so cheeks outside AD Beal that Drummond is the only guy even worth considering after HB
3212,Rishi Nair,1609747541969,And Barnes did play some reliable defense at times
3213,Rishi Nair,1609747554667,AD Lillard Beal*
3214,Faizan Khan,1609747906381,Damn wtf feels weird that Beal is from that class
3215,Faizan Khan,1609747917183,Feels like he should be way later
3216,Faizan Khan,1609747926447,Heâs peaking hella late
3217,Rishi Nair,1609748340616,Yea he had a slower progression
3218,Rishi Nair,1609748358575,But he also doesn't need athleticism too much so he'll prob be elite for 3-5 more years
3219,Rishi Nair,1609748371923,ð
3220,Rishi Nair,1609748538574,Only thing I don't like about Steph dominating esp vs Dame is that people use it to shit on Dame
3221,Rishi Nair,1609748544366,When it's completely undeserved
3222,Ameya Pandit,1609752010074,@Faizan Khan talking shit on Twitter

3447,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609890034791,Hes been hyper about this for 5 years
3448,Hursh Karkhanis,1609890073324,"Itâs like if I said:

3449,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609890199744,loool tbt to that fucking night

3453,Hursh Karkhanis,1609898837353,like at a notably higher rate
3454,Hursh Karkhanis,1609898854905,"(No im not watching porn, just regular TV and Netflix and stuff)"
3455,Alex Duong,1609898882746,Some blondes are p attractive
3456,Alex Duong,1609900660247,Whats up with kuz
3457,Alex Duong,1609900669028,Hes usually better when he starts
3458,Faizan Khan,1609901367118,Idt itâs whether he starts or not itâs just if Bron or AD are out
3459,Faizan Khan,1609901387129,Heâs good
3460,Faizan Khan,1609901403860,Otherwise heâs useless
3461,Faizan Khan,1609901626449,Wait why do the lakers start Marc Gasol over trezz
3462,Rishi Nair,1609901654926,17 likes comment
3463,Alex Duong,1609901666025,Trezz is better off the bench i think
3464,Rishi Nair,1609901668222,Opposite of what Faiz said post the trade
3465,Faizan Khan,1609901814623,i mean it was pretty well documented by reporters
3466,Faizan Khan,1609901822523,ramona shelbourne for one i remember
3467,Faizan Khan,1609901835052,but ok 17 likes on ig proves it wrong
3468,Rishi Nair,1609901944341,I said 17 to specify which comment
3469,Rishi Nair,1609902002369,Interesting thing is Kuz was actually hooping back then to the point where I can understand why some thought his trade value was higher
3470,Rishi Nair,1609902026515,But if you're looking at long term potential and picking Kuz over Brandon X. Ingram you are on crack cocaine and PCP
3471,Faizan Khan,1609902093607,it was a mistake obviously
3472,Hursh Karkhanis,1609902172664,Apple predictive software spot on
3473,Faizan Khan,1609902265633,also ingram age for his class is deceiving af
3474,Faizan Khan,1609902310305,like me and others thought he wasn't shit bc he hadn't lived up to the hype for 3 whole years in the league but he was only 21 still
3475,Faizan Khan,1609902355445,95% by year 3 you know if the guy's gonna be a star
3476,Alex Duong,1609902399054,Ingrams stock was lower than kuzs at the time bc of health concerns
3477,Alex Duong,1609902401256,I think
3478,Alex Duong,1609902421201,He had blood clots
3479,Faizan Khan,1609902473886,that too
3480,Faizan Khan,1609902495303,but moreso play
3481,Faizan Khan,1609902581473,richard sherman was getting clowned a few days ago for his tweet saying kuz was what they wanted ingram to be too LOL

3486,Rishi Nair,1609903436255,Idt it was as bad as CB
3487,Alex Duong,1609903453836,Nah CB was way worse

3495,Faizan Khan,1609903565399,17 and 4.5 on 42% and horrible defense
3496,Alex Duong,1609903594539,His career fg% has always been around 42%
3497,Faizan Khan,1609903595929,after the brooklyn season we all had the guy as like top 15
3498,Faizan Khan,1609903653129,yeah but age wise expected him to get better
3499,Rishi Nair,1609903658602,Wolves are ASS w/o KAT
3500,Rishi Nair,1609903666989,Idt he's even much of a winner

3610,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609908517891,He needs to replicate Barkley but condition better
3611,Faizan Khan,1609908533991,Heâll be a superstar for sure but not like the level of stacking chips
3612,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609908539237,Yeah but i feel like you mean the media right

3625,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609908641428,so now mediaâs on luka sonewhat
3626,Faizan Khan,1609908650127,Luka is somehow like LeBron and not like Lebron at all at the same time
3627,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609908653823,but idk bc i dont watch any sports shows pre playoffs
3628,Alex Duong,1609908662280,luka is like
3629,Alex Duong,1609908668642,a similar mold to bird
3630,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609908673103,heâs older lebron that uses more skill than athleticism
3631,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609908679128,I'm actually worried about the Celtics bc kemba didn't show up in playoffs and they were 2 games away from the finals
3632,Faizan Khan,1609908679336,Has the pass first but also great scorer but one has insane athleticism and one has none and all skill/intangibles
3633,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609908702635,Hes like
3634,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609908704522,@ALEX BABE VERG ð»

3638,Alex Duong,1609908728440,kemba was hurt lol
3639,Faizan Khan,1609908736240,Iâd prob say better passer too
3640,Rishi Nair,1609908741238,LaMelo Ball.
3641,Alex Duong,1609908746030,his knee is still acting up thats why he isnt back yet
3642,Faizan Khan,1609908747942,Obv not talking like all time stuff but just so far
3643,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609908757662,Scoring he's like older wade low-key
3644,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609908769145,Except w step back
3645,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609908791535,Same fakes and post ups
3646,Rishi Nair,1609908802680,Luka is Bird Harden Jokic hybrid
3647,Faizan Khan,1609908818396,Yeah actually good amount of Harden
3648,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609908828300,Nah
3649,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609908833983,Only in terms of role
3650,Rishi Nair,1609908845386,Idfw Harden but it's there
3651,Rishi Nair,1609908847799,Stepback
3652,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609908848662,Also luka doesn't go for foul drawing
3653,Faizan Khan,1609908850452,Offensively they look similar
3654,Rishi Nair,1609908852455,And foul drawing ability
3655,Faizan Khan,1609908855843,Luka more creative
3656,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609908860012,Ok literally its just passing and step back
3657,Rishi Nair,1609908861213,He doesn't go as off the rails for fouls
3658,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609908870543,Harden does not post
3659,Rishi Nair,1609908875717,But he can draw some and it's diff than Bird
3660,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609908893838,we also overlooked Melo in the âno orderâ list
3661,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609908899332,disrespectful
3662,Faizan Khan,1609908907636,Nah heâs not that level
3663,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609908908850,I love melo he's not near those guys
3664,Rishi Nair,1609908912442,I hate that people make the Harden comp more than Bird tho
3665,Rishi Nair,1609908914403,Casuals
3666,Faizan Khan,1609908914499,If weâre gonna say level thereâs a bunch of other guys

3673,Rishi Nair,1609908939006,Idek
3674,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609908939481,Kobe kd harden are all better scorers
3675,Faizan Khan,1609908944983,Iverson
3676,Rishi Nair,1609908952126,Harden not a more versatile scorer
3677,Faizan Khan,1609908955606,Klay just for his role in the dynasty prob above melo
3678,Rishi Nair,1609908961392,Also in Melos prime era idt Harden scores as much

3682,Faizan Khan,1609908982503,Versatile sure
3683,Rishi Nair,1609908990360,Even KD lowkey is more size and athleticism
3684,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609908997226,Yeah its not abt creativity its abt numbers when it comes to scoring
3685,Rishi Nair,1609909002651,But KD has bag fosho too obvi

3698,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909087516,But in terms of numbers and season dominance
3699,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909092804,Harden destroys him
3700,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609909094041,thatâs literally what im talking about
3701,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609909119163,the numbers are already implied in the best of the best convos
3702,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909122070,Nah
3703,Rishi Nair,1609909124693,Melo averaged 26 for 11 years
3704,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909124851,Look at wilt
3705,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909144892,Or like kareem
3706,Rishi Nair,1609909164244,And only bc he had two 22ppg seasons weighing him down in between where he only started 66 and 55 games respectively
3707,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609909165313,"bruh weâre talking about best players since 2000, and youâre not putting melo on the list"
3708,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909166452,Those guys are better scorers than melo even tho melo is better at putting it in the basket
3709,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609909166807,thats cap

3714,Rishi Nair,1609909187415,Then easily
3715,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609909194001,i thought we werent ranking
3716,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909195450,Oh sure if you're talking abt franchise player
3717,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909218804,Vishwa you and rishi are talking about separate things
3718,Rishi Nair,1609909222354,Melo is top 10 all time at his position
3719,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609909235972,im talking that melo should be in the convo for best players since 2000
3720,Rishi Nair,1609909239060,He's in between the franchise player rank and goat rank
3721,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609909244848,all im saying bc i thought thats what we doing
3722,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609909250300,bc not ranking anyone
3723,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909263236,I was talking abt a tier
3724,Rishi Nair,1609909265481,Wilt doesn't count
3725,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909269648,Goat tier
3726,Rishi Nair,1609909270994,He played against me and Ameya
3727,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909280783,This is a diff thing
3728,Faizan Khan,1609909281305,im pretty sure lillard and westbrook have passed melo
3729,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909287825,Oh man
3730,Rishi Nair,1609909290398,Kareem is the greatest scorer of all time volume wise so that's fine

3733,Rishi Nair,1609909311190,Look at playoff success as best player
3734,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909316793,Stats alone gonna put him above
3735,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909326677,And melos never gotten to the finals
3736,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909339471,U guys are making it seem like me and faizan hate melo
3737,Rishi Nair,1609909339781,WB got carried there
3738,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609909353882,wb carried there*
3739,Faizan Khan,1609909356038,"if we're doing ""greatest players since 2000"" i'd give melo top 15-20 approx, i'd have to look into specifics for sure but around there thats why i said he doesnt belong with the 5-6 that rishabh listed @vishwa"
3740,Rishi Nair,1609909356569,Melo never had any teammate close to KD or Westbrook level
3741,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909356960,Dude he averaged a triple double for 3 years back to back
3742,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909363278,Yeah
3743,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909364996,Thank you
3744,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909380316,I made 2 separate points abt goat tier and franchise playeea
3745,Rishi Nair,1609909380773,1st round exit back to back
3746,Rishi Nair,1609909391260,Melo only got bounced vs Kobe
3747,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909392622,And thanks to rishi and u it got jumbled into 1 q

3753,Rishi Nair,1609909447328,Scoring champ and 6x All NBA
3754,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909447900,I hate to say this but melo might not be a top 15 player since the 2000s
3755,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909462271,Theres too much competition
3756,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609909481877,"dontn even need to say top 15, just say best and ur list can be as long as u want"
3757,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609909482588,easy

3760,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609909488293,Top 25 i think def
3761,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609909495996,it's bc he went to the knicks like a bum
3762,Faizan Khan,1609909499518,he was in prime for like 7-8 years
3763,Rishi Nair,1609909508597,25 since 2000???
3764,Faizan Khan,1609909518659,and in that he was amazing a top 5 player multiple scoring champ etc and one conf finals appearance but that aint enough
3765,Rishi Nair,1609909519507,Who's even 20 guys that are better?

3830,Rishi Nair,1609909993449,Even Pierce is like a worse version or about the same as Melo
3831,Rishi Nair,1609909996925,Idt he's greater
3832,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910000558,"if ur using 2 rings as an example, jr smith also has 2 rings and a dunkn contest"
3833,Alex Duong,1609910002004,melo better player but ray had a better career
3834,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910009248,Yeah

3837,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910016210,Thats what matters
3838,Faizan Khan,1609910020302,"i mean boston one wasn't a ""role player"" and miami one he deserves more credit than a regular role player bc he literally hit THE shot"
3839,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910025115,Mhm

3850,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910106169,Ok i dont wanna debate ray allen vs melo bc this is peak vs longevity
3851,Faizan Khan,1609910106499,we're acknowledging his peak wasn't as good
3852,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910117101,Who

3857,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910138625,ur saying ray allen a better shooter than curry?

3860,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910158652,Read what i said
3861,Rishi Nair,1609910159554,Melo was in the tougher West while Ray was w Bucks in East
3862,Rishi Nair,1609910180547,Until he moved west to Seattle
3863,Rishi Nair,1609910188311,And proceeded to win more of nothing
3864,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910200688,ur saying best shootter between bird and curry doesnt that imply that you're comparing those 3
3865,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910206581,ERAS

3872,Rishi Nair,1609910247249,Melo averaged 23.5 over 16 17 years
3873,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910264693,I mean we're talking about career
3874,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910266723,Not scoring

3878,Rishi Nair,1609910295727,Or even 2nd best?
3879,Rishi Nair,1609910345952,Where does Draymond rank
3880,Rishi Nair,1609910348188,ð
3881,Faizan Khan,1609910353949,thing is boston ray wasn't washed it was just his numbers were naturally down bc of usage
3882,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910358380,above melo according to rishabh
3883,Faizan Khan,1609910361333,i see it same way as wade w miami
3884,Alex Duong,1609910371733,he was still the 3rd guy
3885,Faizan Khan,1609910383661,but either way prob melo by a bit
3886,Faizan Khan,1609910393959,"weird bc ray allen feels more ""legend""ish"
3887,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910399577,Yeah which is insane
3888,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910406921,Considering he was getting around 19-20
3889,Faizan Khan,1609910407910,*wade with lebron
3890,Rishi Nair,1609910426976,Ray Ray was often a better passer but even that margin not significant
3891,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910438633,Idk why yall stuck on the ray allen topic i just have him in all time rank above melo
3892,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910443771,And not by a whole lot
3893,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910454696,I think him paul pierce and melo are all neck and neck
3894,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910458089,For that 20th sot
3895,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910459431,Spot
3896,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910482293,paul pierce was the shit but started opening his mouth
3897,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910489209,trynna make hiimself look better than he was
3898,Rishi Nair,1609910491542,Pierce and Melo are All NBA for a reason
3899,Faizan Khan,1609910493047,draymond prob actually around top 30 for 2000s though
3900,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910494587,literally a bum now
3901,Rishi Nair,1609910495598,That's a diff level
3902,Rishi Nair,1609910502005,Greatest players in the game
3903,Faizan Khan,1609910529251,people acknowledge his role in the dynasty despite triple single
3904,Faizan Khan,1609910533223,has a dpoy too right
3905,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910536876,You guys are switching talent and greatness
3906,Rishi Nair,1609910546066,Ray got 1 second team and 1 third
3907,Rishi Nair,1609910555101,Wait so why does it matter for WB
3908,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910556419,they're literally intertwined
3909,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910561013,Nah
3910,Rishi Nair,1609910570748,DPOY and one of the best defenders of all time
3911,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910574464,Otherwise lebron would be the goat definitively
3912,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910577399,to be great you have to be talented
3913,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910584431,but just bc ur talented doesnt mean ur great
3914,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910597354,The reason theres a debate is literally bc of this
3915,Rishi Nair,1609910598361,Should be 2x too
3916,Rishi Nair,1609910607733,They gave it to Kawhi when Dray deserved
3917,Faizan Khan,1609910625600,not even this
3918,Faizan Khan,1609910636810,tom brady
3919,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910641851,lebron potter
3920,Faizan Khan,1609910645501,i think talent makes it much easier for you to be great
3921,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910647873,Duncan
3922,Rishi Nair,1609910656302,Lebron Pandit
3923,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910664855,ur saying brady and duncan aren't/werent talented...
3924,Faizan Khan,1609910665386,but you can be great w/o being talented or talented w/o being great
3925,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910673587,Mhm
3926,Rishi Nair,1609910677721,snake milton ð¥¤ set the nickname for Ameya Pandit to LePandit James.
3927,Faizan Khan,1609910681397,nah bruh brady had legit nothing special about him
3928,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910694636,"brady lead michigan to dubs so many times, he had a feel for the game, that's innate which is talent"
3929,Faizan Khan,1609910707166,he was an avg out of shape white dude with an avg arm
3930,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910707801,Bro aaron rodgers is literally on another planet talent wise
3931,Rishi Nair,1609910710200,Rishi set his own nickname to Carmelo Anahanthony.
3932,Alex Duong,1609910710393,brady was like all intangibles
3933,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910713931,And it doesn't mean shit
3934,Faizan Khan,1609910715343,duncan i think still had more
3935,Rishi Nair,1609910719792,ð
3936,Alex Duong,1609910723105,nothing physically special
3937,Rishi Nair,1609910738533,Agreed here
3938,Rishi Nair,1609910745547,Talent can be diff things
3939,Faizan Khan,1609910749490,if we're including feel for the game as talent then i agree
3940,Faizan Khan,1609910763665,i was thinking physical/skill gifts
3941,Rishi Nair,1609910763947,Luka intangies and feel are talent/skill too
3942,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910774807,Yeah dame too
3943,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910778231,I agree
3944,Rishi Nair,1609910781751,Intangibles are straight up innate
3945,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910784734,Mentality isnt necessarily a talent
3946,Faizan Khan,1609910786344,yeah luka is very skilled
3947,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910796661,"it has to be because you cannt teach feel for the game to anyone, it comes from within"
3948,Rishi Nair,1609910798934,I'm still better
3949,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910799699,You cant say intangibles are talent lmfao
3950,Rishi Nair,1609910814516,Are intangibles something you can work on?
3951,Faizan Khan,1609910819187,like steph curry's shooting
3952,Alex Duong,1609910821978,talent is just your natural ability
3953,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910824633,Yeah
3954,Faizan Khan,1609910825030,ur not gonna learn by practicing most likely
3955,Faizan Khan,1609910831685,but its also a lot of work on top of that
3956,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910832229,You can develop intangibles
3957,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910835748,You cant develop talent
3958,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910835938,physical is only onen side to the talent thinng
3959,Alex Duong,1609910860583,intangibles are like your mindset/character
3960,Rishi Nair,1609910866241,Intangies on a certain level you can never touch
3961,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910867224,"feel for the game is a talent, you cannont teach it at all, otherwise ameya would learn to pass the ball when his team is down 1 and not chuck 3s"
3962,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910874717,Nah
3963,Rishi Nair,1609910877357,Steph shooting/Luka IQ
3964,Faizan Khan,1609910902082,idt steph shooting is an intangible tho
3965,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910902728,Bruh shooting is a talent
3966,Rishi Nair,1609910904323,LOLOLOLOL
3967,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910904842,intangibles can be taught to an extentt BUT not everyoen can do it
3968,Rishi Nair,1609910918035,That level of shooting
3969,Rishi Nair,1609910923094,Who's matching it
3970,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910928063,Exactly
3971,Faizan Khan,1609910930150,thats my point exactly
3972,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910930381,Talent
3973,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910934732,Yeah
3974,Rishi Nair,1609910937182,Maybe some once in a generation freak in a few decades
3975,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910938587,Faizan keep preaching
3976,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910958078,Giannis is one of the most talented 2 way player
3977,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910959439,.
3978,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609910962268,Players ever
3979,Rishi Nair,1609910969897,Is shooting not generally a skill tho
3980,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910978488,"no one can have luka's feel for the game, literally it's in slow mo for him"
3981,Rishi Nair,1609910982919,So Steph's shooting is diff from the other best 3P shooters
3982,Rishi Nair,1609910986878,Who aren't even close
3983,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910990828,which is talent
3984,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609910994038,which isi innate
3985,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609911004819,Nah
3986,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609911015358,Its something you can work on
3987,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609911024273,not to steph's level
3988,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609911040163,Exactly
3989,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609911046044,Thats wherethe talent aspect comes in
3990,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609911058549,rishi just saiid that tho
3991,Alex Duong,1609911060336,"hes naturally a good shooter, but his intangibles brought his shooting to an unworldly lever"
3992,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609911072574,talent isnt just physicals tho
3993,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609911092388,Honestly there's no right answer bc we're all defining it differently
3994,Alex Duong,1609911094511,more of a natural skillset
3995,Faizan Khan,1609911096230,Rishi we are saying the same thing as u about steph
3996,Rishi Nair,1609911102872,Skill is something you can work on
3997,Rishi Nair,1609911106400,Developing skills
3998,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609911108392,no one matching koobe and MJ's mindsets and killer mentality can be taught ot an extent
3999,Rishi Nair,1609911108923,Handle shot etc
4000,Faizan Khan,1609911127694,Ppl can try as hard as they want theyâre likely not reaching that
4001,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609911132925,Mhm
4002,Faizan Khan,1609911133474,So then idt itâs intangibles
4003,Rishi Nair,1609911146085,That is an intangible
4004,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609911147439,Westbrook is insane talent wise
4005,Rishi Nair,1609911150375,Something others can't reach
4006,Faizan Khan,1609911152366,Intangibles is part of perfecting anything yet no matter how much skill but Steph is insanely skilled
4007,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609911157032,Iq and mindset is where he falters
4008,Rishi Nair,1609911170852,Steph is def insanely skilled
4009,Rishi Nair,1609911179393,And I'm insanely gay
4010,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609911202558,The thing about steph is his talent lies in a specific skill
4011,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609911214878,^
4012,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609911221350,I feel like dame works day and night and possibly more than steph on his game
4013,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609911232373,And it doesn't translate to usurping him
4014,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609911267118,This is great tho bc ppl can work on that specific skill
4015,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609911276441,"if someone can't reach a level of shooting, mindset, whaatever to the same extent of a kobe or curry, then that literlaly is intangible by the definitionn of the word because intangible is intertwined only makes talents flourish at that top level"
4016,Rishabh Swarnkar,1609911296031,W someone like lebron its unattainable bc you cant simulate his talent

4035,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609915078867,and no oe ndoing bubbles
4036,Aditya Vishwakarma,1609915091529,and nba has to pay ppl to use bubbles whereas they own stadiums ii'm p sure

4952,Ameya Pandit,1610143641580,Dude theyâre not not open minded
4953,Ameya Pandit,1610143644528,Theyâre open minded*
4954,Ameya Pandit,1610143650031,Itâs not like they stick to that idea
4955,Ameya Pandit,1610143654124,Itâs okay to be different

4957,Ameya Pandit,1610143671456,These guys are good people who just happen to disagree with me
4958,Ameya Pandit,1610143676800,I know shitty people who agree with me
4959,Ameya Pandit,1610143684459,Does that mean my side is all shitty people?
4960,Ameya Pandit,1610143760624,Like taking politics out of it these guys are GOOD people with good intentions
4961,Ameya Pandit,1610143782484,One of the things I hate about being woke is cancelling that voice
4962,Ameya Pandit,1610143789412,All it does is enable it even more in their eyes
4963,Ameya Pandit,1610143799455,But thatâs my take Iâm sure ur gonna disagree Lol
4964,Faizan Khan,1610144816318,I agree and disagree. What ur saying in general is applicable for republicans/people who lean right in general but Trump supporters in particular are fucking dangerous and need to be shut down. We see what nationalist mobs with fascist leaders can do around the word (holocaust biggest example among several others) and we were seeing a glimpse of going in that direction on Wednesday straight up
4965,Faizan Khan,1610144896145,I just feel like the maga crowd has surpassed âdifferent political beliefs that we can disagree withâ and need to be taken as the serious threat they are and shut down as hard as possible and not normalized
4966,Ameya Pandit,1610145020216,Driving will provide literature of my own

5039,Faizan Khan,1610164954502,Theyâre all showing nice potential but none popping
5040,Faizan Khan,1610164958694,Edwards has to be best rn tho
5041,Rishi Nair,1610164963862,Almost as many points and 5 times as many rebounds and assists
5042,Rishi Nair,1610164969520,5 times
5043,Rishi Nair,1610164978111,Also twice as many steals
5044,Rishi Nair,1610164988916,More efficient too LOL
5045,Rishi Nair,1610165016287,Melo would be doing a lot better if he actually got minutes but that doesn't work in his favor for ROY race
5046,Faizan Khan,1610165029299,They all have about the same minutes rn
5047,Faizan Khan,1610165063671,Wiseman has the least actually

5517,Rishi Nair,1610490247956,W relatively not even that much help
5518,Alex Duong,1610490266279,he doesnt defend tho
5519,Rishi Nair,1610490281773,Gets steals at least so it's not a complete wash on that end

5599,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610504610589,but the ones i got were hella good too
5600,Alex Duong,1610505667708,Danny green has 21 3 pt attempts
5601,Alex Duong,1610505670971,And made 9
5602,Faizan Khan,1610506560948,I think Embiid Jokic is now like
5603,Faizan Khan,1610506576705,The thing ppl used to say about âx is the best player whoâs a pg but y is the best pure pgâ
5604,Faizan Khan,1610506598273,Jokic can do more probs but he doesnât do traditional center shit
5605,Faizan Khan,1610506610035,For that Embiid is clearly the best when you think of what a center does
5606,Faizan Khan,1610506635726,But overall player rankings Jokic >
5607,Faizan Khan,1610506672557,When u think of dominant centers you think of tim protecting and dominance in the paint
5608,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610507303881,doesnr matter if he doesnt do âtraditional center stuffâ if hes a better player
5609,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610507316669,hes clearly more valuable to his team than jokic
5610,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610507321399,than embiid**
5611,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610507340030,i say as embiid scores 45 and 17 to beat the heat
5612,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610507397945,https://twitter.com/NBAonTNT/status/1349176967053111296?s=20

5615,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610507416533,STEPH CURRY'S 3 POINT STUDENT
5616,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610507429520,Bron hit em wit the Steph Curry turn around before the 3 goes inâ¦and then follows with a spin move and-1
5617,Faizan Khan,1610508148041,I mean we donât know this but Iâm not disagreeing with you on whoâs better
5618,Faizan Khan,1610508160574,It just might not be apples to apples
5619,Faizan Khan,1610508169015,Like theyâre great in completely diff ways
5620,Shripad Bangaru,1610510574648,embiid might be more valuable thats tought
5621,Shripad Bangaru,1610510583414,i mean we saw murray in the playoffs
5622,Hursh Karkhanis,1610510940681,something I heard said that it philly got shooters (Simmons learned to shoot) that they would be amazing bc embiid can stay in the post where he can just dominate
5623,Hursh Karkhanis,1610510942935,Is that true
5624,Shripad Bangaru,1610511187153,if simmons learned to shoot? yeah
5625,Hursh Karkhanis,1610511539200,yeah sorry typo daal
5626,Alex Duong,1610511589330,Ideally yes
5627,Alex Duong,1610511607261,Idt Simmons wants to do that tho
5628,Faizan Khan,1610511670635,They have better shooters this year than last at least
5629,Hursh Karkhanis,1610512037383,it said they shouldnât have gotten rid of reddick
5630,Alex Duong,1610512414711,Seth curry is a good addition for them
5631,Alex Duong,1610512787012,he basically does the same things as redick
5632,Faizan Khan,1610519716739,Wait Melo or Klay?

5635,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610519825891,klay > melo
5636,Alex Duong,1610519933111,klay doesnt get enough recognition
5637,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610519975585,2nd or 3rd best shooter all time
5638,Alex Duong,1610520015471,we just dont know what he is as like the best player on a team

5642,Alex Duong,1610520217641,but i would have klay as a ray allen tier player

5661,Hursh Karkhanis,1610520981284,Itâs funny because I used to want the total opposite
5662,Hursh Karkhanis,1610521016943,Iâd like to think Iâve grown to the point where Iâm confident enough where I now want what the âindependentâ one mentioned above ^

5670,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610521423932,yeah bc a relationship is inidependent people beign together they're not like some homogenous person
5671,Hursh Karkhanis,1610521453951,Yup exactly
5672,Hursh Karkhanis,1610521500551,I already made this analogy before but: i wanna be in a Frank and Clair Underwood type relationship minus the illegal activity and cheating
5673,Hursh Karkhanis,1610521562629,In House of Cards they literally plot and scheme together for years to eventually rise to power
5674,Hursh Karkhanis,1610521569480,Thatâs what I want
5675,Hursh Karkhanis,1610521601996,Two independent people who are in love and come together to conquer
5676,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610521770553,yaas

5678,Alex Duong,1610521783548,i have contemplated making a hinge
5679,Alex Duong,1610521787070,should I?
5680,Alex Duong,1610521792777,id only use in the bay tho
5681,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610521902658,dating apps kinda garbage ngl
5682,Hursh Karkhanis,1610521985954,"nah, use this time to get ripped and otherwise a better version of yourself and then explore when Covid ends"
5683,Hursh Karkhanis,1610521996444,You have 8-12 months
5684,Alex Duong,1610522010875,good idea
5685,Hursh Karkhanis,1610522012035,I donât mean you like YOU I just mean IMO thatâs what someone should do in this time
5686,Hursh Karkhanis,1610522056017,but ya that includes you in this example
5687,Hursh Karkhanis,1610522406173,change is slow
5688,Rishabh Swarnkar,1610526333502,Do it
5689,Rishabh Swarnkar,1610526344949,I disagree w hursh and vishwa
5690,Rishabh Swarnkar,1610526355442,Hinge is pretty good
5691,Rishabh Swarnkar,1610526366849,I feel like worst case you stop using it
5692,Rishabh Swarnkar,1610526380894,But ive gone out on a couple of hinge dates and its not bad
5693,Rishabh Swarnkar,1610526391324,Tbh i like the prompts it helps drive conversation
5694,Rishabh Swarnkar,1610526406243,I dont see why you cant do this simultaneously lol

5699,Rishi Nair,1610531771165,Nah Jokic
5700,Rishi Nair,1610531822635,I think any level of passing above 5/6 assists by default makes you damn valuable esp the more natural it is aka not forced
5701,Rishi Nair,1610531871943,But better
5702,Rishi Nair,1610531958725,I'd be so down to see Klay lead his own team but it prob won't ever happen
5703,Rishi Nair,1610531972279,Shouldn't at least unless Steph is out or something for a little bit

5717,Rishi Nair,1610567377529,Nets offered a huge package
5718,Rishi Nair,1610567384598,This made me laugh LOL
5719,Rishi Nair,1610567394270,Cuz initially they said anybody but Kyrie and KD

5723,Rishi Nair,1610567475846,Also I really like that idea of building w Wall and Wood
5724,Rishi Nair,1610567485571,They should get Caris and others from Brooklyn
5725,Rishi Nair,1610567641532,Also wanna see Harden in Brooklyn bc just Embiid prolly isn't enough to win but KD is
5726,Rishi Nair,1610567663182,Fuck it'd prob fuck KD for fantasy tho nvm

5729,Alex Duong,1610568899185,basically he wants out of houston
5730,Rishi Nair,1610568981796,I can't even say I don't respect Harden
5731,Rishi Nair,1610568987941,He's just being selfish basically
5732,Rishi Nair,1610569009560,But he's def not a leader and he prolly won't ever win a fucking cheeto let alone a championship
5733,Alex Duong,1610569038473,personally i dont like what harden brings to a locker room
5734,Hursh Karkhanis,1610569038823,"he prob just wants to be in the NBA for lifestyle and money, cant really blame him too much"
5735,Alex Duong,1610569048243,but bc of the talent teams will pursue
5736,Hursh Karkhanis,1610569057103,but i still think he shoulda like been respectful and come to practice LMAO
5737,Hursh Karkhanis,1610569060253,right?

5741,Hursh Karkhanis,1610569311861,ya like he will never win anything and he doesnt care about winning anyway so cant really hate it other than now showing up to practice which is actually bad

5770,Rishi Nair,1610572627560,Multi team makes sense
5771,Rishi Nair,1610572646850,Rip Jarrett Allen's illustrious Nets career
5772,Rishi Nair,1610572723440,LeVert Kurucs and the picks are big

5777,Faizan Khan,1610572774930,The sixers
5778,Faizan Khan,1610572778862,Package was prob better
5779,Rishi Nair,1610572788051,Sixers prob didn't have picks
5780,Faizan Khan,1610572790500,Also they didnât even get dinwiddie holy
5781,Rishi Nair,1610572816295,If u could combine sixers and nets package like Simmons Maxey LeVert that'd be perfect
5782,Faizan Khan,1610572816408,Kyrie gonna be super mad I doubt they asked his permission for this
5783,Rishi Nair,1610572832044,Should've gotten him although out for season
5784,Rishi Nair,1610572844939,Who gives a fuxk

5803,Faizan Khan,1610573095093,Like Iâm sure they had much better offers earlier
5804,Rishi Nair,1610573096603,Indiana fucking robbed
5805,Alex Duong,1610573098127,they lost their leverage
5806,Alex Duong,1610573102880,when harden went public
5807,Faizan Khan,1610573106459,Yup
5808,Faizan Khan,1610573117622,Shouldâve acted faster or waited longer
5809,Faizan Khan,1610573142427,Like if ur not gonna include Kyrie then get the entire core of the rest of the role guys
5810,Faizan Khan,1610573151067,They were ready to give that
5811,Rishi Nair,1610573154183,LOL Rockets are just the epitome of a p unfortunate franchise
5812,Rishi Nair,1610573157747,Other than Hakeem
5813,Rishi Nair,1610573168084,Everything's been p unlucky/downside
5814,Rishi Nair,1610573173681,Yao and T-Mac injuries
5815,Rishi Nair,1610573180545,CP3 hammy selling
5816,Rishi Nair,1610573198817,Even Hakeem era they only won cuz some bald dude decided to play baseball
5817,Rishi Nair,1610573252193,Nvm I think they keeping
5818,Faizan Khan,1610573291340,KD on his way to another worthless chip fr
5819,Rishi Nair,1610573311948,Losing LeVert for Oladipo just makes zero sense tho
5820,Rishi Nair,1610573315659,Ur not gnna contend rn
5821,Rishi Nair,1610573326776,And Vic isn't even that much better atm than LeVert
5822,Rishi Nair,1610573362692,Vic is a guard nearing 30 w knee problems
5823,Rishi Nair,1610573365764,That's never good
5824,Rishi Nair,1610573417057,This literally affects both my fantasy teams
5825,Rishi Nair,1610573426827,I have Harden in one league KD in other

5829,Rishi Nair,1610573634312,This is p fucking stacked but nowhere near as meaningless as GS chips
5830,Faizan Khan,1610573666048,Just wanted to see him win with a normal team
5831,Rishi Nair,1610573668981,In fact when u have Bron AD and a really deep Lakers team this is just much closer to the type of comp they should be facing in the finals
5832,Rishi Nair,1610573673885,Not last year's heat
5833,Rishi Nair,1610573700823,To be real I think if Kyrie played and conducted himself like a normal human being
5834,Faizan Khan,1610573707211,Lakers Nets should be fun barring one of them cooking
5835,Rishi Nair,1610573708173,I think they would've made Finals almost forsure
5836,Faizan Khan,1610573719474,Choking*
5837,Rishi Nair,1610573723519,But chip would've been a toss up
5838,Faizan Khan,1610573730837,Yup
5839,Rishi Nair,1610573754081,I might have had to roll Lakers given added depth to a group already experienced in playing w each other
5840,Faizan Khan,1610573756659,But I also think kyrie really donât like this
5841,Faizan Khan,1610573764678,He apparently didnât want it
5842,Rishi Nair,1610573771689,But Nets were deep as shit w two clutch 30ppg mfs leading
5843,Faizan Khan,1610573773796,And they did it now that heâs off the grid
5844,Faizan Khan,1610573786313,So he might even want out or something idk
5845,Hursh Karkhanis,1610573797215,so basically this is gonna be Real Housewives of New York type situation
5846,Rishi Nair,1610573797750,Even otherwise that playstyle is a chore to figure out imo
5847,Rishi Nair,1610573801717,Kyrie and Harden
5848,Rishi Nair,1610573811969,Kyrie's usage rate is at 38% this year
5849,Rishi Nair,1610573815872,Highest it's ever been
5850,Alex Duong,1610573836250,nets finna run iso on every play
5851,Alex Duong,1610573852025,theyll put up like 130 a night tho

5870,Rishi Nair,1610574606073,If it's just Harden and KD that's tougher but if Caris was still there I would've given them a solid chance still

5915,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610575105153,who teh fuck gonna play that
5916,Alex Duong,1610575110450,they have no perimeter defenders
5917,Faizan Khan,1610575112323,Like clippers will be back letâs see what they do talent wise they still have just as much
5918,Alex Duong,1610575117500,and have mike d as an assistant
5919,Alex Duong,1610575124994,defense is a foreign concept to them
5920,Alex Duong,1610575134882,more likely to play cherrypicking
5921,Rishi Nair,1610575141932,Clips have just as much or less of a shot to beat Nets
5922,Rishi Nair,1610575155719,Idt they'd fare better than Bron
5923,Rishi Nair,1610575159666,W AD helping
5924,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610575183014,clipps still need their pg
5925,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610575193416,"but lakers cliippers wcf, lakers nets finals"
5926,Rishi Nair,1610575220474,Idk why they don't run Kennard at point
5927,Rishi Nair,1610575224039,Instead of spotting up
5928,Rishi Nair,1610575300433,This is verrryyy interesting
5929,Ameya Pandit,1610575308178,Lakers could start
5930,Rishi Nair,1610575311074,Cuz Bron p much had a wide open championship window
5931,Ameya Pandit,1610575315676,Aditya vishwa
5932,Rishi Nair,1610575317524,For the next 3-4 years
5933,Ameya Pandit,1610575320254,And still win the title
5934,Rishi Nair,1610575326690,But now a new contender emerges
5935,Rishi Nair,1610575348055,Do u actually believe that
5936,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610575348595,iâm better than half the nets roster bruh
5937,Ameya Pandit,1610575361946,Source: havenât watched a single nba game this year ð¤£ð¤£
5938,Hursh Karkhanis,1610575557092,join the club
5939,Rishi Nair,1610575863507,70s stunt double fellow ð¤£
5940,Faizan Khan,1610576056736,Rajesh
5941,Hursh Karkhanis,1610576058041,shirt fits you well despite you said u arent lifting
5942,Faizan Khan,1610576130326,Also Lebron is gradually declining still
5943,Faizan Khan,1610576165645,Like longevity is still crazy and heâs still the best but thereâs no denying heâs getting slightly worse by year
5944,Rishi Nair,1610576174951,Fits beautifully when ur arms are actually bigger than a boba straw
5945,Rishi Nair,1610576235733,Nowhere near 2016 LeBron to be able to beat these guys
5946,Faizan Khan,1610576296106,But also you have
5947,Faizan Khan,1610576307916,Prime AD now
5948,Faizan Khan,1610576322996,And their fit is perfect
5949,Faizan Khan,1610576325606,So idk either way
5950,Faizan Khan,1610576335393,Yet
5951,Faizan Khan,1610576354959,The key with Brooklyn is Kyrie and Harden have to make it work
5952,Faizan Khan,1610576361815,KD can do his thing regardless
5953,Faizan Khan,1610576390039,And a much better rest of team than last year
5954,Rishi Nair,1610576636717,Lowkey tho some additions looking tamer now
5955,Rishi Nair,1610576640412,Gasol namely
5956,Rishi Nair,1610576649311,He's been blocking some shots lately tho
5957,Rishi Nair,1610576669880,Harrell idk how much of a difference he's made but Schroder been nice
5958,Faizan Khan,1610576709249,Gasol was never gonna be shit
5959,Faizan Khan,1610576714926,Heâs been washed
5960,Faizan Khan,1610576733013,I think his best contribution would be on like a team that needs a veteran presence
5961,Rishi Nair,1610576737469,I didn't think he'd be this bad
5962,Rishi Nair,1610576835237,LOL if Bron beats Kyrie KD and Harden he's the goat
5963,Rishi Nair,1610576854964,If he beats them in 7 I think
5964,Shripad Bangaru,1610577137878,"Good for houston, they got some hope for the future"
5965,Shripad Bangaru,1610577164039,Also brooklyn with just harden and durant is deadly
5966,Shripad Bangaru,1610577182006,Even if their games may not sync that well
5967,Rishi Nair,1610577213862,Deadly but not unbeatable
5968,Faizan Khan,1610577225350,Kyrie and Harden is just the question
5969,Rishi Nair,1610577281699,I think assuming Kyrie plays it's not even that big of a problem
5970,Rishi Nair,1610577286985,Harden should defer some
5971,Rishi Nair,1610577296688,Basically all 3 should be taking turns getting theirs
5972,Rishi Nair,1610577320139,And clutch time is the only thing to figure out but I'm also thinking they'd be blowing teams out by that time

6133,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610665071828,it's kinda actually sad how superstars can just come into a team and fuck up the entire established order
6134,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610665088624,bc that nets team with dudley and dlo was fucking amazing to watch they had so  much potential
6135,Rishi Nair,1610665151833,Marks would always preach development too and Atkinson would run it
6136,Rishi Nair,1610665174918,Everybody was always hype for each other doing well too
6137,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610665411586,that playboy carti meme is the personification of how fun that team was

6147,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610668242457,is the kyrie situation REALLY that bad
6148,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610668267505,bc they're making it look like it's the end of the world and suuperstars are gonna get anything and everything they want
6149,Faizan Khan,1610670934833,i mean its pretty bad
6150,Faizan Khan,1610670957409,we're in a pandemic everyones losing their jobs and this man
6151,Faizan Khan,1610670981127,"is getting paid 35M and isn't playing bc ""he doesnt feel like it"" without even informing the team and violating covid protocols w/o caring"
6152,Faizan Khan,1610670998211,i didnt watch FT or undisputed for this but nick wright's take was spot on
6153,Faizan Khan,1610671006427,and he's generally SUPERRRR pro player
6154,Rishi Nair,1610671061757,If my father SAS said it's bad it's bad
6155,Faizan Khan,1610671113670,and 2nd part is literally true and its becoming more and more clear
6156,Faizan Khan,1610671137272,player mobility is great but can go back to the era where contracts mean anything

6162,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610672411134,and if they actually decide to play unselfishly esp kyrie and harden
6163,Faizan Khan,1610672671823,how would kyrie and harden play together tho
6164,Faizan Khan,1610672675297,fit wise
6165,Faizan Khan,1610672683229,either of them alone with durant would be great
6166,Faizan Khan,1610672768497,also their bench looks much weaker now with levert gone and dinwiddie torn ACL
6167,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610673512954,that video shows it
6168,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610673518667,harden's a lot better off ball than ppl give him credit for
6169,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610673526711,but yeah they need the touches
6170,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610673573190,yeah this is their concern but if they can literally switch out harden kyrie and kd throughout the game they dont need a strong bench
6171,Ameya Pandit,1610678990991,Wait dinwiddle hurt??
6172,Alex Duong,1610679086669,Torn acl

6227,Hursh Karkhanis,1610732695753,But in reality rich people are they people who need it far less than poor people
6228,Hursh Karkhanis,1610732710611,but I appreciate him being honest about his stance like he always is

6268,Hursh Karkhanis,1610745962265,thats terrible bruh
6269,Hursh Karkhanis,1610745987343,"part of that is not their fault, its like student loans and shit, but most of it is prob buying shit they cant afford"
6270,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610746057232,yup
6271,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610746063834,bc personal finance is not taught in schools
6272,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610746072689,and it benefits the banks because of that
6273,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610746088046,bc theyâll just collect interest off of missed payments
6274,Hursh Karkhanis,1610746243515,so fucked up
6275,Hursh Karkhanis,1610746544588,bro they taught us how to find the area of the shape that would be created if a line with equation y = 5x^3 + 2x^2 - x + 5 were rotated 360 degrees (i think this was math analysis) but they didnt teach us how to invest or how to use credit
6276,Hursh Karkhanis,1610746587615,i learned all that money from google and graham stefan
6277,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610746972440,would it help if i told you that they use calculus to find out how to make a tunnel through a mountain? they calculate thee area of a negative curve and go from there
6278,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610746979711,i think that's pretty aplicable to irl life
6279,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610747000932,or if i told you that headlights are tangent lines to the curve of a road so you can technically find the derivative of a curvy road
6280,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610747038441,only principle of business taught me some ppersonal finance bc they had us write checks and balance checkbooks and all that
6281,Hursh Karkhanis,1610747286678,ahhhh writing checks.....sounds like 2012

6734,Rishi Nair,1610865597418,KD tone was kinda/p disrespectful too tbf
6735,Rishi Nair,1610865617114,Calling Kyrie little as shit and stuff too
6736,Alex Duong,1610865712667,these are two of the weirdest dudes in the league
6737,Faizan Khan,1610866542771,KD and Harden balled together today damn
6738,Faizan Khan,1610866560097,I think KD Harden or KD Kyrie both work great
6739,Faizan Khan,1610866565872,Just not Kyrie Harden
6740,Faizan Khan,1610866569665,Letâs see though
6741,Faizan Khan,1610866592565,Need to watch the literature vishwa provided for that
6742,Rishi Nair,1610866641142,I think Ky Harden KD will work only if Kyrie lets it
6743,Faizan Khan,1610866738372,I think they should be favs but theyâre beatable
6744,Faizan Khan,1610866742090,Even before the finals
6745,Rishi Nair,1610866767147,Hellll no
6746,Rishi Nair,1610866773618,Who the fuck beating them in the east
6747,Faizan Khan,1610866783316,I mean like theyâd have to fuck up themselves
6748,Faizan Khan,1610866792204,Then maybe Celtics Heat
6749,Faizan Khan,1610866802027,Bucks no chance Giannis hasnât fixed his FTs
6750,Faizan Khan,1610866828565,But Nets should win it as long as their not on glue themselves (which is likely)
6751,Rishi Nair,1610866841271,Heat the only ones w a chance and that's only cuz of Jimmy
6752,Rishi Nair,1610866861807,Celtics have more balanced starpower than Heat but unproven in comparison
6753,Rishi Nair,1610866888385,I lowkey just felt sorry for the dude for a min but then
6754,Rishi Nair,1610866899567,He had a p wide open conference last few years
6755,Rishi Nair,1610866906104,Since Kawhi left forsure
6756,Faizan Khan,1610866958394,Giannis like
6757,Faizan Khan,1610866981625,Will go down by default as an all time great but he NEEDS to alter some shit to really get over the hump when it matters
6758,Faizan Khan,1610866988491,Which he def can cuz heâs 25
6759,Rishi Nair,1610867019221,He has the mentality which I respect immensely
6760,Rishi Nair,1610867023174,So won't count him out
6761,Ameya Pandit,1610867289106,Hahahahaha
6762,Ameya Pandit,1610867322679,Itâs not really giannis the man itâs his play style and what the team does
6763,Ameya Pandit,1610867334041,Sounds kinda familiar to something else..hmmm....
6764,Ameya Pandit,1610867346850,"no but seriously, I donât understand why they didnât sell
The house to get cp3"
6765,Ameya Pandit,1610867352023,Their half court offense is fuck all
6766,Rishi Nair,1610867541743,Yea but his playstyle is what needs to be expanded using his relentless work mentality

6776,Rishi Nair,1610867777002,3 isn't absolutely necessary and it's already serviceable enough
6777,Rishi Nair,1610867835994,Making 1.5 a game on 30.5%

6817,Hursh Karkhanis,1610873145629,and then another twist is that all three of them eventually get caught in the same illegal activity so they have to do other illegal shit to not get caught

7259,Hursh Karkhanis,1611123934280,bro the across the street neighbors got power back a full hour and a half before us and my dad things its bc they have solar
7260,Hursh Karkhanis,1611123981399,"is solar something you can like keep in storage and then 'tap into' when you want?
or is it like always being used"
7261,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611124341236,yeah
7262,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611124346341,that's what the tesla powerwall is
7263,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611124351791,it stores the energy from a solar sell
7264,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611124352635,cell
7265,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611124390765,so technically they should have had pwoer the whole day if they had a storage solution
7266,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611124419707,"but if not then idk, i doubt olar creates enough power at a time to just use instantaneously"
7267,Hursh Karkhanis,1611125168047,the vid im watching says we would have to install panels in the desert and also maybe on top of the water (called floating solar farms)
7268,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611125492333,yup
7269,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611125507140,we legit have enough space in deserts to make solar farms (and maintain them)
7270,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611125513073,to power most if not all the state
7271,Hursh Karkhanis,1611126030773,yeah
7272,Hursh Karkhanis,1611126063999,it said the places most in need of cheap energy are also the sunniest places (africa) so it can work
7273,Hursh Karkhanis,1611126102555,if they can pull that off that will be one hell of a humanitarian effort

7755,Rishi Nair,1611389394903,I can understand the bringing him along slowly w a little restraint approach so he adjusts and learns comfortably but this is just stupid

7793,Alex Duong,1611441010311,atm at least
7794,Alex Duong,1611441038204,and their only experienced coach is mike d antoni who doesnt believe in defense

7815,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611441363196,hes the most unselfish but kyrie and harden gonna battle

8880,Faizan Khan,1611892920156,i watched the
8881,Faizan Khan,1611892924137,netflix doc of jfk
8882,Faizan Khan,1611892934241,apparently him and his wife had a hella superficial relationship
8883,Faizan Khan,1611892936674,right
8884,Alex Duong,1611892946012,he wasnt a good husband lol
8885,Faizan Khan,1611892958958,like his dad basically got them married bc he needed a wife to fit the typical mold to become president
8886,Hursh Karkhanis,1611892968479,Havenât seen a Netflix doc but Iâve seen others and yeah that seems right
8887,Hursh Karkhanis,1611892980980,Yeah his dad basically built him
8888,Faizan Khan,1611892992476,he was in love with some nazi or something before
8889,Hursh Karkhanis,1611893007678,LMAOOO hahaha didnât know that but ya I believe it
8890,Hursh Karkhanis,1611893018033,He was a horny boi (this is a good thing)
8891,Faizan Khan,1611893024537,inga arvad
8892,Hursh Karkhanis,1611893091799,"Fun fact: 

KENNEDY was able to win the state of Illinois with the help of his dad and also Frank Sinatra who both had mafia connections and Illinois/Chicago was very mafia/Italian at the time"
8893,Faizan Khan,1611893188049,was he actually a good president
8894,Faizan Khan,1611893194362,or just loved bc he was assasinated
8895,Alex Duong,1611893197653,i think so
8896,Alex Duong,1611893204135,he screwed up the cuban missle crisis
8897,Alex Duong,1611893210632,but other than that was fine i think
8898,Hursh Karkhanis,1611893250875,this played a major part but he did good things too
8899,Hursh Karkhanis,1611893258348,Idk specifically though
8900,Alex Duong,1611893298678,in apush we were told him being good looking really helped with his election
8901,Hursh Karkhanis,1611893312741,One thing I know is that if he didnât get shit he would have been blamed for Vietnam but since he got shot the blame went to LBJ
8902,Hursh Karkhanis,1611893342574,"Yeah 1960 election, first televised debate, he looked really good on TV where as Nixon looked sweaty and old and bad"
8903,Hursh Karkhanis,1611893375804,And Nixon had some facial hair visible (which at the time was seen as negative) so that hurt him too
8904,Hursh Karkhanis,1611893519117,shot** LOL
8905,Rishi Nair,1611893543998,His wife was bad as fuck

9129,Rishi Nair,1611979713886,Embiid is leading MVP
9130,Rishi Nair,1611979733821,Bron wasn't even top 3 until recent hot streak w 3s
9131,Rishi Nair,1611979747597,But Jokic is closing in they're on a winning streak now
9132,Rishi Nair,1611979759793,Embiid Steph 1 and 2

9143,Hursh Karkhanis,1611981357018,do u understand the joke daal
9144,Rishi Nair,1611981600551,Yea lmao how many rookies scoring 7 in one min
9145,Rishi Nair,1611981613434,They got Melo on way too short a leash
9146,Rishi Nair,1611981649129,Mfs wanna talk about turnovers well Steph used to have a big turnover issue when he was younger
9147,Rishi Nair,1611981657208,And was nowhere near as good a passer back then
9148,Rishi Nair,1611981663780,But they let him work through it
9149,Faizan Khan,1611981862457,This is literally the effect of Lavar Ball lmao
9150,Faizan Khan,1611981880708,Not like itâs out of the blue
9151,Faizan Khan,1611981892797,U canât keep saying whatever with no consequences
9152,Faizan Khan,1611981919053,Gordon Haywardâs dad is not publicly taking a dump on the coach and saying his son is secretly unhappy there
9153,Rishi Nair,1611982086811,Maybe partly
9154,Rishi Nair,1611982105196,Borrego comes from the Spurs system so I think it's mainly that
9155,Rishi Nair,1611982115187,He's less down w the reckless abandon
9156,Rishi Nair,1611982177120,And I agree Melo should be averaging no more than ~3 turnovers and honestly has the potential for like 8 ast to like 3.4 TO as a rookie if they gave him 30+ mins a night
9157,Rishi Nair,1611982201277,Prime he'll prob average 11-13 apg depending on how much scoring
9158,Alex Duong,1611982388563,whats up with dallas
