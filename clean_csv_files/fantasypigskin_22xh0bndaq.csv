729,Faizan Khan,1597646421205,Hopefully nfl doesnât get as bad
730,Faizan Khan,1597646431379,But they couldâve thought of smth or another

755,Hursh Karkhanis,1597673283725,Hey Iâm a baseball fan
756,Hursh Karkhanis,1597673286494,But I agree
757,Alex Duong,1597684125266,Mlb is the least progressive of all the pro leagues
758,Hursh Karkhanis,1597688424337,yup :(
759,Hursh Karkhanis,1597688820017,its sad because (in my opinion) its really is such a nice beautiful game but it just happens to be 1) slow/boring for most people 2) too localized 3) sort of racist fan base 4) sort of fratty culture 5) non innovative people in charge
760,Alex Duong,1597688877909,Mhmm
761,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597688891541,"The league sucks at attracting a younger demographic which is why they don't do as well. The NBA is great at it, which is why they have grown so much"
762,Alex Duong,1597688892561,Ive been to an angels game
763,Alex Duong,1597688896624,Almost fell asleep
764,Hursh Karkhanis,1597688958002,and part of the reason for that is the actual game itself just happens to be slow and long where as basketball happens to be fast and dynamic
765,Hursh Karkhanis,1597688988241,ya i used to put on baseball highlights sometimes when i was tryna go to sleep lmao
766,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597689007109,playoffs are fun though
767,Hursh Karkhanis,1597689015052,playoffs are fucking amazing
768,Hursh Karkhanis,1597689027271,but march-sept is kinda a drag lmao
769,Hursh Karkhanis,1597689068124,"they should allow fans to bet on every pitch, every result of an atbat, etc etc it would skyrocket viewership"
770,Hursh Karkhanis,1597689120364,"literally what if fans could bet if the next pitch was a fastball, curveball, whatever else then they would literally watch every pitch"
771,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597689139487,the astros would rig that up

1513,Faizan Khan,1597878544792,So much fucking respect for this man
1514,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597878570027,I think he will start for them this year
1515,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597878586683,"Before he went down, they were 5-2"
1516,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597878607911,He was going to the playoffs instead we got those shitty cowboys
1517,Alex Duong,1597878616225,Maybe midseason if haskins is bad
1518,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597878646722,U think so ?
1519,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597878666887,"Letâs see if he can ball, Iâm still up in the air on him"
1520,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597878677230,Smith is better
1521,Alex Duong,1597878691471,He just got cleared right
1522,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597878701509,"Yeah, he can practice"
1523,Faizan Khan,1597878706971,"Was a bust for 5 years didnât give up, Kaepernick replaced him cuz of an injury when he was having his best season and he was unfazed and supportive, helped Mahomes learn the ropes and replaced him, turns around Washington for a bit only to have 17 surgeries and life threatened and heâs still coming back"
1524,Alex Duong,1597878717347,Its just theres lots of rust hes gotta shake off
1525,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597878729030,No preseason too
1526,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597878732747,That sucks
1527,Rishabh Swarnkar,1597878741107,I wish we'd gotten arod but I do respect smith
1528,Faizan Khan,1597878746353,He should easily start over Haskins if heâs healthy
1529,Rishabh Swarnkar,1597878778062,Honestly
1530,Rishabh Swarnkar,1597878787565,He and Haskins both deserve a chance in spotlight
1531,Rishabh Swarnkar,1597878792047,Obv smith more but
1532,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597878800336,Yâall seen Zeke Elliot on ESPN? He looks so much bigger than his rookie year
1533,Rishabh Swarnkar,1597878805981,Haskins was touted as best qb in his class
1534,Faizan Khan,1597878836302,Earlier on yes but not at draft time
1535,Faizan Khan,1597878839962,Also
1536,Faizan Khan,1597878871616,I agree he deserves another chance but he stunk it up last year
1537,Alex Duong,1597878899082,He got better as season went on (albeit against lower comp) but lets see
1538,Faizan Khan,1597878968457,no no kyler
1539,Faizan Khan,1597878976440,but daniel jones is also better lol
1540,Rishabh Swarnkar,1597878993176,Forgot
1541,Faizan Khan,1597878994109,its not close until haskins proves otherwise
1542,Faizan Khan,1597879051830,kyler is about to be real raw this year
1543,Faizan Khan,1597879057085,mvp candidate
1544,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597879455516,Why does Drew Lock get no love ?
1545,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597879479327,Heâs pretty solid
1546,Alex Duong,1597879522453,Hes a sleeper
1547,Alex Duong,1597879546756,Them and raiders gonna be in the hunt for wild card i think
1548,Faizan Khan,1597879579842,he's been getting hella
1549,Faizan Khan,1597879582777,he just hasnt proven much
1550,Faizan Khan,1597879586455,he had like 4 good games?
1551,Faizan Khan,1597879632593,his weapons are INSANE now though
1552,Alex Duong,1597879655512,Their oline is good right
1553,Alex Duong,1597879668220,Ik there were questions abt garrett bolles
1554,Faizan Khan,1597879679015,i think theyre avg?
1555,Alex Duong,1597879699787,Pat shurmer is a good oc tho

1558,Faizan Khan,1597879848588,hot take
1559,Alex Duong,1597879970914,Until tua arrives
1560,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597972104607,Knicks got the 8th pick in the draft. Does any other franchise have such shitty luck ?
1561,Rishi Nair,1597972200076,Honestly now I'm intrigued to see who they get
1562,Rishi Nair,1597972210658,Maybe a gem falls to them
1563,Rishi Nair,1597972225822,Okoro for ex but idt they could develop him well offensively
1564,Rishi Nair,1597972237235,If he did become a star it'd be on his own merit
1565,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597972246701,"Maybe but when they draft a gem, they toss it away just like Kristaps"
1566,Alex Duong,1597972247991,I dont trust the knicks with developing young players
1567,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597972270320,"Exactly, they need to draft a new owner"
1568,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597972278222,Tear it all down
1569,Rishi Nair,1597972298792,I'm right here
1570,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597972546090,"U for my vote, I would let Faizan get a crack it"
1571,Faizan Khan,1597972580079,No worries RJ Barrett is the next Kobe
1572,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597972589431,Excuse you?
1573,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597972632368,No he isnât . Kobe has a great owner with a great team. Allowed him to develop as a winner. Knicks canât do that
1574,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597972645750,Had* ð­ð­ð­
1575,Faizan Khan,1597972673256,Nah
1576,Rishi Nair,1597972676193,RJ should be a better passer
1577,Rishi Nair,1597972695949,And less killer instinct until the guy can finish around the fucking rim
1578,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597972700082,Pass to who? Taj Gibson ?
1579,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597972706625,Come on now
1580,Faizan Khan,1597972714303,Julius Randle
1581,Rishi Nair,1597972721726,Mitchell Robinson
1582,Faizan Khan,1597972737849,I was kidding lol
1583,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597972764543,Where were those two last year ?
1584,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597972778492,Watching Tatum blow by them for dunks
1585,Rishi Nair,1597972866293,Averaging 2bpg in just 23mpg ð
1586,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597972921915,Robinson can play but he is more deandre Jordan than embid
1587,Rishi Nair,1597973002883,He has work to do still primarily w foul trouble and developing offense but once he does he'll be better than DeAndre ever was
1588,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597973018298,"Problem is getting young talent, itâs how to nurture it and the Knicks havenât been able to do that"
1589,Faizan Khan,1597973101408,this was lakers not knicks
1590,Faizan Khan,1597973106538,knicks just cant get talent
1591,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597973111524,I canât put my finger on whatâs the problem because they have changed everything around for years so it has to be the owner right ?
1592,Faizan Khan,1597973127870,they had one guy and he forced his way out
1593,Rishi Nair,1597973135934,Knicks have gotten all the young talent they just couldn't do shit w it
1594,Rishi Nair,1597973143509,Benched and cut Allonzo Trier
1595,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597973149062,Smh
1596,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597973157227,Played Ron baker instead
1597,Alex Duong,1597974864429,Mitchell Robinson is nice tho
1598,Alex Duong,1597974877080,I think he slipped in his draft
1599,Rishi Nair,1597975263796,Slipped cuz he skipped college to focus on the draft
1600,Alex Duong,1597975282987,ah
1601,Alex Duong,1597975382802,also how's josh Jackson doing
1602,Rishi Nair,1597975919314,Not too bad w Memphis
1603,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1597976636205,Isn't Josh Jackson a backup?
1604,Shripad Bangaru,1597998952500,He was super selfish with the ball apparently
1605,Aditya Vishwakarma,1597999178056,wtf are we in 2017?
1606,Aditya Vishwakarma,1597999195963,i just saw josh jackson and mitchell robinson

1610,Aditya Vishwakarma,1597999228650,max 20 point scorer and 8 assists
1611,Rishabh Swarnkar,1597999237775,He is arguably top 15 rn
1612,Aditya Vishwakarma,1597999242738,hes not even hitting 10 w zion bruv
1613,Rishabh Swarnkar,1597999246997,I think 15-20 but yea

1628,Rishabh Swarnkar,1597999586638,Also mitchell playoffs is better than kyrie boston playoffs
1629,Rishabh Swarnkar,1597999603600,Cleveland debatable
1630,Rishi Nair,1597999606925,I'm better than Kyrie Boston playoffs

1637,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1598029289588,"Thats who we need, Brooklyn can handle Kyrie's feelings"
1638,Alex Duong,1598029591344,Kyrie is basically the default nets gm
1639,Alex Duong,1598029597193,Kd to an extent too
1640,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1598029676283,"The real question is, how many coaches will they go through?"
1641,Alex Duong,1598029682219,Core is there just need a solid interior defender or rebounder
1642,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1598029696982,I wanted to get Tristan thompson

1647,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1598029738940,Atleast we can beat Embiid
1648,Alex Duong,1598029845306,Tacko is a nice story and great guy
1649,Alex Duong,1598029863181,But i doubt he becomes decent
1650,Alex Duong,1598029893393,I didnt wanna trade baynes but i think we had to to get kemba
1651,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1598029905519,"We should remember that Boban didn't become great at first either, Tacko needs time"
1652,Alex Duong,1598029918231,Hmm tru
1653,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1598030035329,Boston can develop young players to be good depth so I'm not worried long term. I mean we got a 5 ft 8 in point guard in the all star game
1654,Alex Duong,1598030093472,Ahh good days
1655,Alex Duong,1598030141873,He was like our only decent scoring option during those times and we ran everything through him
1656,Alex Duong,1598030151034,And then his hip gave in
1657,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1598030214477,I don't feel bad that we didn't pay Thomas but I feel bad because he never got even a small payday for his glory days
1658,Alex Duong,1598030235685,Ya he wasnt worth 30 mil
1659,Alex Duong,1598030253054,There was a ceiling with him
1660,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1598030289091,"Yeah, atleast Rondo and Kyri got paid elsewhere after we let him go but he didn't"
1661,Alex Duong,1598030312221,"Even tho kyrie only lasted two yrs, it was the worst gamble we didnt really give much"
1662,Alex Duong,1598030329223,Only that pick that became sexton
1663,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1598030385000,"We lost ante zizic, could have been something in our system"
1664,Alex Duong,1598030395448,Where is he now

1667,Alex Duong,1598030426570,Ahh
1668,Alex Duong,1598030457010,I thought they moved him elsewhere
1669,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1598030519317,They lowered his stock so much they won't get anything good from a trade
1670,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1598030650046,Watch him go to the spurs and shine in a couple of years
1671,Alex Duong,1598030973216,How much longer will pop coach
1672,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1598031040923,"Good question, team has no young star in the making and the team is old and not winnding"
1673,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1598031046433,winning*
1674,Alex Duong,1598031108413,The kawhi trade set them back a while
1675,Alex Duong,1598031120256,They should've tried to get a young core for him

1680,Hursh Karkhanis,1598326416842,"1) fuck Herschel Walker for that

2) the fact that Trump told that couple who pulled their guns in front of protesters to speak is proof that he is stoking racism (like we needed more proof lol)

3) the Wisconsin video of the cop shooting that black guy in the back like 7 times is just as egregious as the George Floyd killing"

1688,Faizan Khan,1598474878736,Not the whole season theyâre boycotting individual games
1689,Faizan Khan,1598474913876,Celtics raptors discussing boycotting game 1

2132,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600119012540,"Exactly, Seattle is way too big of a market to let go. I mean it beats Memphis by a lot"
2133,Faizan Khan,1600119069693,move the celtics to seattle
2134,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600119108585,Why Boston loves the Celtics while the grizzlies are losing a lot of money

2139,Faizan Khan,1600120545607,That would also mean
2140,Faizan Khan,1600120553362,Jayson Tatum is the best athlete in Seattle
2141,Rishi Nair,1600122520641,Move the Celtics to Arkansas
2142,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600123218208,"Ur right, historic franchises sometimes need to progress and leave the craphole they left behind. Kinda like how the Raiders dumped Oakland for Vegas"
2143,Hursh Karkhanis,1600128795745,is it me or is spots kinda boring to watch this year bc theres no fans
2144,Hursh Karkhanis,1600128811529,idk for me part of the fun is imagining youre actually there at the game as a fan
2145,Hursh Karkhanis,1600129230455,like this empty crowd looks kinda ehh IMO
2146,Faizan Khan,1600129494101,It def takes away from the experience
2147,Faizan Khan,1600129518087,But gotta take what we get these days
2148,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600129597707,"this angle is depressing, but itâs not the same for basketball since they got the screens for fans and its smaller court so angles are tighter"

2184,Faizan Khan,1600201705406,That segment was so objectively terrible
2185,Faizan Khan,1600201732504,His main argument was we beat bad teams and lose to good teams. Weâve had the EXACT opposite reputation over the last 5 years
2186,Faizan Khan,1600201742778,Like literally the exact opposite
2187,Faizan Khan,1600201774163,We can beat any elite team on any given Sunday but will blow games against the fucking raiders and bears when massive favorites

2204,Faizan Khan,1600210813773,He seeked out help this offseason
2205,Faizan Khan,1600210827853,For depression/anxiety

2208,Rishi Nair,1600210985440,When Dak said that I totally forgot about the loss he faced
2209,Hursh Karkhanis,1600211124303,i mean lets be honest how surprised are you on a scale of 1 to 10
2210,Alex Duong,1600211140964,hes never spoken that way abt mental health
2211,Hursh Karkhanis,1600211398111,"im glad dak spoke up the more big macho tough rich famous guys than can speak out on mental health and seeking help, the less of a stigma there will be"
2212,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600211503397,ð® analyst
2213,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600211593290,dak and klove are trailblazing the convo for mental health in sports
2214,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600211599804,and i love it
2215,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600211635014,"bc sports fans forget that athletes are people too, and hold them on such high of a pedestal"

2222,Hursh Karkhanis,1600212466392,"https://stockx.com/nike-kyrie-5-friends i remember i used to want these last year, should i cop or nah"
2223,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600212492290,Watch Kevin Durant use that as an excuse when he doesnât win in Brooklyn
2224,Hursh Karkhanis,1600212523814,stfu they are gonna win ringz
2225,Alex Duong,1600212549148,nets are the best team on paper
2226,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600212552106,Got two of the biggest divas in the league but sure itâs gonna be great
2227,Alex Duong,1600212557189,most talented at least
2228,Rishi Nair,1600212606006,I don't even really think sp
2229,Rishi Nair,1600212616207,I'd take Lakers over them cuz Bron AD
2230,Rishi Nair,1600212627402,If Lakers fill out the rest of the roster better it's wraps
2231,Faizan Khan,1600212629580,dak also in literally the most pressured position in american sports
2232,Faizan Khan,1600212634514,qb of the dallas cowboys
2233,Faizan Khan,1600212644024,which is nothing compared to his personal losses obviously
2234,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600212719390,yes
2235,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600212748636,"yeah shit, i forgot about demar degoar"
2236,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600212752376,degoat
2237,Faizan Khan,1600212754618,yeah either them or clippers purely on paper
2238,Faizan Khan,1600212760616,clippers bumming rn tho
2239,Alex Duong,1600212773613,nets have two solid bigs
2240,Alex Duong,1600212829539,I think they're gonna trade Jarrett allen tho
2241,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600212839296,"just us a better 3&d substitutes for quin cook, jared dudley and lowkey kostas and weâre big chillin"
2242,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600212847333,ideally 3 avery bradleys
2243,Faizan Khan,1600212863247,warriors > lakers next year
2244,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600212871018,stupid idea heâs hella good
2245,Alex Duong,1600212883431,Deandre is best friends with the two stars
2246,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600212903359,he old
2247,Alex Duong,1600212903918,and the coach got fired cuz they disagreed on starting allen or DJ
2248,Faizan Khan,1600212913567,kyrie just needs to play his 2016 role
2249,Alex Duong,1600212927957,id wanna see Jarrett in boston
2250,Alex Duong,1600212951028,but I heard rumors nets are interested in getting a 3rd star
2251,Faizan Khan,1600212953388,idt lakers will be that great next year that roster is old as hell
2252,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600212954494,id wanna see jarrett in LA
2253,Faizan Khan,1600212966246,lebron himself decline gonna start speeding up
2254,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600212972367,yeah we are thats why we gptta shed some bois
2255,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600212985367,i trust rob
2256,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600212990451,Maybe thatâs why he wanted AD
2257,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600213019648,"it IS why he wanted AD, lebron can actually try on defense nowdays since he doesnt have to carry the offensive load"
2258,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600213032676,as opposed to last year w cle and first w lakers
2259,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600213053223,he played pretty good defense all season long
2260,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600213053432,I also think having a dominant big man who can do so much means a lot to a aging star
2261,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600213072087,yeah generational talent too
2262,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600213086399,"AD should sign a 2 year deal w us, not a max"
2263,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600213097647,depending on who we can attract in FA
2264,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600213100198,I think he does one year at a time
2265,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600213106610,Learning from Lebron
2266,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600213128028,Also Lebron saved this franchise cause itâs poorly run without him
2267,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600213128454,he is big time
2268,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600213137822,cap
2269,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600213149498,but also not cap
2270,Alex Duong,1600213157081,this is true
2271,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600213157979,we were developing fine w the young core
2272,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600213164816,but magic was the shit part
2273,Alex Duong,1600213175383,moreso in the Jim buss days
2274,Alex Duong,1600213180569,slightly better now
2275,Alex Duong,1600213184131,*after
2276,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600213184866,"rob is quite good as a gm i like him, and we have pretty damn good scouts"
2277,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600213199827,"magic was the one stain, post jim buss"
2278,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600213259253,apparently lonzo wants to return to lakers (not bc he signed w klutch)
2279,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600213263513,but id rather not
2280,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600213291595,i dont want my pg not being able to shoot above 60% FT
2281,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600213308811,and generally passive
2282,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600213785347,"No u were not, Lonzo was never gonna be a star and Kuzma was pushed aside for ð"
2283,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600213812441,ingram doe
2284,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600213834804,"Also @Aditya Vishwakarma werenât u a Heat fan, how are the lakers now ur team ?"

2316,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600214163438,Let Kris go for nothing

2356,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600214561811,how his arm did not disconnect from shoulders is a miracle
2357,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600214567106,Played the whole game and would pitch 2 innings the next couple
2358,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600214571759,True

2366,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600214730397,"Idk, giants are 500 not sure about As"
2367,Alex Duong,1600214737192,A's are good
2368,Alex Duong,1600214739079,apparantly
2369,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600214742232,Ask @Shripad Bangaru
2370,Cole Quinn,1600214745919,giants are actually better than dbacks surprisingly
2371,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600214773024,As were wildcard or somethin right? like last year

2375,Faizan Khan,1600214813581,marcus smart
2376,Faizan Khan,1600214817806,boston celtics mvp
2377,Alex Duong,1600214829879,fr
2378,Faizan Khan,1600214830426,dude's been on a tear
2379,Alex Duong,1600214835648,defends too
2380,Faizan Khan,1600214846542,10x better than numbers and numbers are great rn too
2381,Rishi Nair,1600214955915,Game breaking defensive impact and showing out on offense too
2382,Hursh Karkhanis,1600215054167,i think youre talking about 2014
2383,Hursh Karkhanis,1600215082387,when he pitched the most innings in a WS and then pitched more in game 7
2384,Hursh Karkhanis,1600215104717,i think that was when he went from an SF star to someone everyone in the country knew
2385,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600215394128,"Yeah, itâs been a while but thatâs what I was referring 2"
2386,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600215400698,Never saw that before
2387,Hursh Karkhanis,1600215742826,"baseball is interesting bc its all about decision making and its ""simple"" enough that regular people can *sort of* understand it"
2388,Hursh Karkhanis,1600215764768,esp when it comes to pitching changes/using the bullpen
2389,Rishi Nair,1600215767366,Cricket>
2390,Hursh Karkhanis,1600215788127,i knew rishi was gonna say something dumb when h saw he saw the message
2391,Hursh Karkhanis,1600215817654,cricket is better than baseball tho i agree
2392,Faizan Khan,1600215929508,doesnt baseball just depend on how much money your team has
2393,Faizan Khan,1600215935478,i feel like thats kinda depressing
2394,Alex Duong,1600215938095,not entirely
2395,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600215940777,No
2396,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600215946004,Look at the Yankees
2397,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600215950546,Only one title
2398,Hursh Karkhanis,1600215955210,not really or else yankees redsox and dodgers would always win
2399,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600215968920,U can throw giants in there 2
2400,Faizan Khan,1600215970897,i mean not 100% but theres a clear advantage right
2401,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600215977840,Slightly yes
2402,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600215988582,Pittsburgh isnât winning anything
2403,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600216003807,Other than a participation trophy
2404,Hursh Karkhanis,1600216021554,"not really, its all about defense and situational hitting, and money doesnt always buy that"
2405,Cole Quinn,1600216024356,whatâs dumb is every mlb is rich af itâs just that some donât spend
2406,Cole Quinn,1600216030716,*owner
2407,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600216038563,Same with nba
2408,Faizan Khan,1600216040209,why dont they make a salary cap
2409,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600216046333,Players said no
2410,Rishi Nair,1600216047890,So just like football
2411,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600216057815,Not even the same bro
2412,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600216068147,Look at their track record
2413,Rishi Nair,1600216085090,Vs Raiders ð
2414,Cole Quinn,1600216086798,pirates are like the browns of baseball
2415,Rishi Nair,1600216104712,I knew them cuz of McCutchen
2416,Alex Duong,1600216106797,teams like the A's choose not to spend anything
2417,Hursh Karkhanis,1600216112248,idk old mentally
2418,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600216121401,They need to relocate
2419,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600216129694,Go to Vegas
2420,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600216149168,Oakland doesnât deserve a professional team
2421,Faizan Khan,1600216151692,nba nfl i dont think owners spending is relevant
2422,Faizan Khan,1600216153604,bc salary cap
2423,Faizan Khan,1600216159801,they all spend the same amount
2424,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600216167529,How many people wanna play in Sacramento
2425,Cole Quinn,1600216170858,luxury tax but pretty much yeah
2426,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600216175086,I rest my case
2427,Faizan Khan,1600216185971,nba still has an adavntage to big markets tho cuz star mobility
2428,Faizan Khan,1600216199369,i mean that doesnt stop them from building a good team
2429,Faizan Khan,1600216202743,memphis doing it
2430,Alex Duong,1600216212816,Memphis cant attract fans tho
2431,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600216217308,They have tried but the talent always wants to leave
2432,Faizan Khan,1600216218022,hell kings themselves kinda are
2433,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600216226521,They need to go to Seattle
2434,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600216235922,Bring back the Sonics
2435,Hursh Karkhanis,1600216298041,one think i do like about football is that players change teams all the time i think thats kinda cool
2436,Hursh Karkhanis,1600216303208,like GOOD players
2437,Alex Duong,1600216313269,the cap is so strict
2438,Alex Duong,1600216338346,partially bc of qb money
2439,Alex Duong,1600216348396,the chiefs are like paying everyone idk how
2440,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600216354320,Right but football teams need more than one guy nba can be changed by one one dude
2441,Faizan Khan,1600216358417,? way less than nba
2442,Faizan Khan,1600216370606,also franchise qbs NEVER do
2443,Hursh Karkhanis,1600216383833,oh i thought they did idk it seems like the good players are on a different team eveery year
2444,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600216387274,Unless they r 42 and want to
2445,Hursh Karkhanis,1600216399669,nah not franchise QB's i mean like leade reciebevers and backs
2446,Faizan Khan,1600216415410,the best qb i've seen move in his prime is kirk cousins
2447,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600216422366,Some do but they r tryna get paid. In the nba stars get paid no matter where they go which is why there is more movement
2448,Faizan Khan,1600216439995,oh yeah wrs and rbs move around a lot
2449,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600216443347,Like that bitch KD

2468,Faizan Khan,1600220063823,jimmy and 1 probably even better
2469,Rishi Nair,1600222606940,Jimmy could end up getting Wade type of love in miami if he wins there
2470,Rishi Nair,1600222617242,Not the same level obvi
2471,Faizan Khan,1600223005787,I wonder if Miami fans are back
2472,Alex Duong,1600223020138,They only show up when the team is good
2473,Faizan Khan,1600223021714,They have a pretty fair weather fanbase I think
2474,Faizan Khan,1600223023947,Yeah
2475,Faizan Khan,1600223032696,And I donât think even they expected this team to be this good
2476,Rishi Nair,1600223038770,@Aditya Vishwakarma ?
2477,Rishi Nair,1600223045134,Mmm idk
2478,Rishi Nair,1600223054526,I've practically been a secondhand fan
2479,Rishi Nair,1600223060991,Been watching everything about them
2480,Rishi Nair,1600223072308,And we all know what Jimmy is capable of
2481,Rishi Nair,1600223081281,And now this is the best team he's ever had around him
2482,Rishi Nair,1600223083703,Hands down
2483,Rishi Nair,1600223108909,It's a mix forsure
2484,Hursh Karkhanis,1600223787529,Isnât every fan base pretty fair weather
2485,Hursh Karkhanis,1600223805148,Same
2486,Rishi Nair,1600223828422,Not the RAIDERS
2487,Hursh Karkhanis,1600224141736,Tru
2488,Faizan Khan,1600224148697,To an extent yeah but some moreso than others
2489,Hursh Karkhanis,1600224172950,Who do you think is the most bandwagon fan base
2490,Alex Duong,1600224196931,In all of sports?
2491,Hursh Karkhanis,1600224200905,Yeah
2492,Rishi Nair,1600224212449,Pats and Lakers up there forsure
2493,Alex Duong,1600224219177,Prob a bball team
2494,Rishi Nair,1600224229152,Dubs we did get hella bandwagoners
2495,Alex Duong,1600224234028,Since a good amount of fans are just fans of individuals
2496,Faizan Khan,1600224235177,"I think itâs geographical, like Florida and Cali teams are moreso than east coast teams"
2497,Faizan Khan,1600224252782,Or Midwest teams
2498,Faizan Khan,1600224261682,Not each but generally
2499,Faizan Khan,1600224316717,Not raiders ofc
2500,Rishi Nair,1600224346653,We'll defff get some soon tho
2501,Rishi Nair,1600224353975,Soon being a relative term
2502,Rishi Nair,1600224371598,But like the way u can tell is how loyal the fanbase was when u were down
2503,Rishi Nair,1600224380138,And Dubs and Raiders like the epitome of that
2504,Hursh Karkhanis,1600224405036,Yeah Matt Barnes says warrior fans were loyal in bad days
2505,Rishi Nair,1600224428965,Reggie Jackson has been so ass
2506,Hursh Karkhanis,1600224436332,Honestly maybe Lakers
2507,Hursh Karkhanis,1600224445006,most bandwagon fans
2508,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600224446794,"Ok, no they weren't"
2509,Rishi Nair,1600224459852,Much of the bay doesn't care about sports in general but there were quite a lot of people who were diehard Dubs fans
2510,Rishi Nair,1600224465004,And still are ofc
2511,Hursh Karkhanis,1600224475136,Yeah I can see them being loyal
2512,Faizan Khan,1600224557091,They def were
2513,Faizan Khan,1600224570716,Warriors games were packed and there was energetic
2514,Faizan Khan,1600224581384,Obv youâll get the extra random people when ur a dominant team
2515,Rishi Nair,1600224592180,We were selling out arenas since before Steph was drafted
2516,Rishi Nair,1600224600984,And even before We Believe
2517,Rishi Nair,1600224609787,And after Run TMC
2518,Rishi Nair,1600224617751,So when we were really really ass
2519,Faizan Khan,1600224622589,I guess if u wanna talk about our particular area like cupertino then yeah LOL
2520,Hursh Karkhanis,1600224636987,Yeah I think Indian and Asian people were the bandwagons
2521,Hursh Karkhanis,1600224650187,Bc they went from not caring to warrior stans
2522,Rishi Nair,1600224655251,And doing shit like taking Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant
2523,Hursh Karkhanis,1600224669690,But Iâm sure there were tons of loyal black and Latino fans pre 2008
2524,Rishi Nair,1600224681234,And over Peja Nash Jermaine
2525,Hursh Karkhanis,1600224681299,And whites
2526,Rishi Nair,1600224688964,Asians too
2527,Rishi Nair,1600224696438,Dubs esp had more Asian fane
2528,Rishi Nair,1600224712180,Some Indians too ngl
2529,Hursh Karkhanis,1600224713849,Like Filipinos ?
2530,Rishi Nair,1600224727999,Diff kinds of Asians
2531,Rishi Nair,1600224741566,Filipinos def just cuz ball runs thru their veins
2532,Hursh Karkhanis,1600224864079,Yeah
2533,Hursh Karkhanis,1600224867674,I wonder why that is
2534,Rishi Nair,1600224915206,It's a little random yea
2535,Hursh Karkhanis,1600225210528,Maybe itâs the only popular sport in the Philippines
2536,Rishi Nair,1600225254354,It's like cricket for India but I have no clue who introduced ball to the Philippines
2537,Rishi Nair,1600225264774,Cricket was the British's doing
2538,Hursh Karkhanis,1600225273846,Rishi do u watch graham bensinger

2740,Faizan Khan,1600290950142,tldr: his argument is this all comes down to one thing he chose the wrong team in free agency

2742,Rishi Nair,1600291277200,He went to a pretty great on paper team that was supposed to be highly functional esp in one of the most important aspects of the game; defense

2775,Hursh Karkhanis,1600295876131,"he also said he has a photogrpahic memory so its not that hes ""smart"" his brain just works like that"
2776,Hursh Karkhanis,1600295899553,imagine the things i'd do if i had a photographic memory ;)
2777,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600295907929,media rode clippers all season long as favorites
2778,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600295921887,until  literally now
2779,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600295932241,except unc shannon sharpe
2780,Faizan Khan,1600295946288,They were favorites but Lebron was fucking fantasized all seaosn
2781,Faizan Khan,1600295948083,By the media
2782,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600295954045,remember stock prices based on second
2783,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600295969161,lakers were the heroes but they werent the favorites
2784,Faizan Khan,1600295972316,And anyone who said a word against him would be shat on
2785,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600295987797,bc of kobe they got the âheroesâ lavle
2786,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600295989486,lable
2787,Faizan Khan,1600295993495,Nah even before
2788,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600295996452,label* but even before
2789,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600296006822,we were likable bc we didnt have the same issues as clippers
2790,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600296025293,"but every discussion they were like clippers still have the better bench, and best clutch players"
2791,Faizan Khan,1600296047296,Thatâs true but Bron was still the darling
2792,Faizan Khan,1600296050719,Clippers the villain
2793,Faizan Khan,1600296059683,This season I agree with pavi
2794,Faizan Khan,1600296062590,Itâs been annoying
2795,Faizan Khan,1600296067619,And overdone
2796,Faizan Khan,1600296071154,Too much dickriding
2797,Faizan Khan,1600296079947,Itâs just thereâs a past where heâs dealt witn the exact opposite
2798,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600296085371,weâre not even in top 5
2799,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600296090134,according to that
2800,Faizan Khan,1600296101459,Man would breathe and itâs like 35 YEARS OLD KING TAKE FLIGHT GOAT
2801,Faizan Khan,1600296129017,Bruh everyone had the lakers as 2nd before the season idk who made this LOL
2802,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600296145810,this was literally aired on espn i think on the jump
2803,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600296172648,"well its also kinda deserved bc everyone was like he cant do this in the west and now look ar him in the wcf, but i agree some of the âdickridingâ was a bitch much"
2804,Faizan Khan,1600296187213,I know but itâs literally not accurate if weâre talking about the public
2805,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600296188597,i think you guys remember more the dickriding and i remember more the criticism
2806,Faizan Khan,1600296195396,It was pretty clearly 1 clippers 2 lakers 3 bucks
2807,Faizan Khan,1600296206560,This thing is prob just some advanced analytics thing
2808,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600296225506,bc i remember any show i watched they would praise lakers and bron and then be like CLIPPERSSSS
2809,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600296237650,crack analytics
2810,Faizan Khan,1600296269238,yeah no one's denying clips were favs
2811,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600296269309,Can we agree small ball doesnât work ?
2812,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600296283393,Rockets were decimated in rebounding
2813,Faizan Khan,1600296302483,but that has nothing to do with lebron being seen as beloved can do no wrong and exaggerated everythign he did this year
2814,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600296309270,Should have gotten Harden a wing not a another guard
2815,Faizan Khan,1600296310489,he also is lowkey dramatic himself LOL
2816,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600296320351,True itâs the Lebron effect
2817,Faizan Khan,1600296323916,im not saying hes a bad guy i think he's an amazing guy but he's def a little dramatic
2818,Faizan Khan,1600296336821,he won't let his shit go unnoticed
2819,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600296342865,Itâs the current era of nba stars
2820,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600296348090,Super babies
2821,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600296428506,Case in point the Nets current superstars
2822,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600296523998,wait okay
2823,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600296530563,no one is as big of a baby as kd and kyrie
2824,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600296557228,theyâre on their own level
2825,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600296602255,"and i disagree all of the new stars emerging are tough, mentally forsure"
2826,Faizan Khan,1600296821705,thing is tho rockets took it to an absolute extreme
2827,Faizan Khan,1600296872193,general small ball with still a decent center playing good minutes can work (warriors)
2828,Faizan Khan,1600296876967,you cant take anything that extreme
2829,Faizan Khan,1600296894950,rockets had a 6'5 dude starting at center what do they think will happen
2830,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600296928872,"yeah thatâs the best formula so far, even our lineup rn putting AD at center with morris at 4 works very well"
2831,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600296972204,Yeah but Davis is acting like Duncan. Doesnât wanna play center
2832,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600297092026,nah he said heâs willing to do whatever it takes to win
2833,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600297098843,said it during rockets series
2834,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600297105518,but he def prefers the 4
2835,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600297136452,Canât argue with that heâs played well. Stepped up this year in the playoffs when the team needed him
2836,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600297626676,yep
2837,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600297681141,Iâm curious on what the bucks will do. I think they should target Booker or Beal
2838,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600297702482,Giannis needs to get a shooter who can score consistently
2839,Rishi Nair,1600297802895,I like the idea of CP3 and Giannis that shit about personalities is bs

2845,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600298155242,cp3 gonna do well w giannis
2846,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600298157786,Beal probably more likely
2847,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600298168551,yeah suns got a bright future
2848,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600298169916,But John wall will back

2850,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600298190933,"dude im sorry, itâs great that walls gonna be back but theyâre not winning shit in DC"
2851,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600298200555,I guess
2852,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600298211656,Iâm still excited to see him again
2853,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600298215622,they have a scrappy ad team and talent tho
2854,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600298222446,scrappy af
2855,Faizan Khan,1600298448013,suns aren't trading booker at any cost

2918,Alex Duong,1600562381066,ya probs
2919,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600562407873,I mean heâs the second best qb in the league
2920,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600562426090,Mahomeboi is clearly the best
2921,Faizan Khan,1600562437354,dan asked him do u think ur the best qb in the nfl and he was like i believe so without a doubt and then named a bunch of guys too

2928,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600562542750,People never saw Tom as the best even after winning
2929,Faizan Khan,1600562571254,i mean since 2014ish everyone knows it

2985,Hursh Karkhanis,1600590330692,hmm idk
2986,Hursh Karkhanis,1600590367635,"i think some smaller city, idk"
2987,Hursh Karkhanis,1600590533171,he said something about people commuting from GER to NED every day for work so i guess somewhere near the border ??
2988,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600590555991,"Idk, he crossed border for work"
2989,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600590576924,I would to live in Vancouver and work in Seattle
2990,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600590595674,But hyperloop isnât real yet ð
2991,Hursh Karkhanis,1600590623210,yeah lol
2992,Hursh Karkhanis,1600590633568,i mean remote work is the future!
2993,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600590644282,No f that
2994,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600590662140,Hyperloop makes a 4 hour car trip into 15 min
2995,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600590693340,So theoretically it would allow me to live in Vancouver and commute to Seattle
2996,Hursh Karkhanis,1600590712348,that would be cool
2997,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600590753886,U should look at the concept videos on YouTube if u like trains
2998,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600590797670,With car sales going down and gas reliance dimming public transport might be the future to deal with traffic and population problems
2999,Hursh Karkhanis,1600590818445,yup def agree with that
3000,Hursh Karkhanis,1600590872329,i think trains are cool af too living in SF for 4 years i think its cool u can get all around the city or even all around the bay with hem
3001,Hursh Karkhanis,1600590938333,"i wanna live in new york i like very lowww key know the subway map there by heart, i think that system is amazing"
3002,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600590961646,I really like Seattle and Boston
3003,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600590976427,Decent housing and good infrastructure
3004,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600590985192,Not to mention tech hubs
3005,Hursh Karkhanis,1600591023922,its really easy to understand like all you need to know is which direction you are going and which train you need and the stations are labeled so clearly
3006,Hursh Karkhanis,1600591031934,heard good things about SEA
3007,Faizan Khan,1600591378832,the stops all smell like piss but yeah great system

3009,Hursh Karkhanis,1600591470314,I didnât notice anything but Idk if I just got lucky or if Iâve been jaded by SF smells
3010,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600591501258,"Come to Austin, homeless people with less smells"
3011,Hursh Karkhanis,1600591511728,Both can be downright filthy esp when you add homeless people in SF UGH
3012,Hursh Karkhanis,1600591530754,Yee always wanted to go to Austin

3016,Hursh Karkhanis,1600591625540,"Thing I like about NYC is that the system covers the whole damn city, all 5 bouroughs, every Mile"
3017,Hursh Karkhanis,1600591648714,SFs train system only covers maybe 40% of it?? Itâs crappy
3018,Hursh Karkhanis,1600591708524,Wow Facebook probably cut the quality of that screenshot by 90%

3025,Hursh Karkhanis,1600591913818,"i cant even place a finger on why i like it so much, i guess its that all the things people from california find repulsive about NYC, i find charming"
3026,Hursh Karkhanis,1600591938282,"the crowds, the trains, the noise, the energy, the activity, the history, etc etc"
3027,Faizan Khan,1600591957919,yeah makes sense its one of those things you either like or you don't
3028,Hursh Karkhanis,1600592232340,"i also really like walking around, i dont mind it at all"

3254,Alex Duong,1600661056145,deck chairs and lawn furniture
3255,Alex Duong,1600661221063,their d made Jared Goff look like tom brady
3256,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600663659547,Eagles r going through some issues rn
3257,Hursh Karkhanis,1600663689301,i was thinking earlier
3258,Alex Duong,1600663694851,their oline is their strength and its decimated
3259,Hursh Karkhanis,1600663712806,u can prob train and run a ML model to predict whether a team is gonna run a pass play or run play
3260,Hursh Karkhanis,1600663727279,"Based on down, distance, quarter, time, if they are winning or not, field position, etc etc,"
3261,Hursh Karkhanis,1600663760603,if i get some data i'd like to try it it cant be that hard
3262,Hursh Karkhanis,1600663959516,wonder what other criteria there are
3263,Hursh Karkhanis,1600664007036,maybe current rush yards/pass yards ratio to see if the team is having a good running game or a good passing game
3264,Hursh Karkhanis,1600664195410,oh shit def timeouts remaining
3265,Faizan Khan,1600665968221,next capstone
3266,Hursh Karkhanis,1600716849145,saquan :(

3268,Faizan Khan,1600717583938,Saquon truly devastating
3269,Faizan Khan,1600717604552,Hope he comes back and the ACL doesnât permanently damage him
3270,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600717997407,what tf is happening with all these injuries
3271,Faizan Khan,1600718867535,No preseason prob a factor
3272,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600718907026,"Idk, most stars donât play in preseason anyway"
3273,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600718923145,Might be lack of training camp and OTAs
3274,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600719132918,didnât teams have training camps?
3275,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600719146446,ik niners had practice and stuff at least
3276,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600719150388,"No, mostly cut down"
3277,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600719154887,rip
3278,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600719160629,Wasnât the same amount of time
3279,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600719171316,Sure that was a huge factor
3280,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600719181278,Mostly vets getting hurt
3281,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600719191292,Rookies are good
3282,Hursh Karkhanis,1600719249465,weird theory: i feel like these pro athletes are actually more injury prone than regular people because they need so much fine tuning and time to train/prep/get in shape to play at (their version of) 100% that if you dont get that train/prep/get in shape time something is going to go wrong
3283,Hursh Karkhanis,1600719267718,thats why all the best athletes always talk about recovery recovery recovery
3284,Hursh Karkhanis,1600719289148,"i think kobe took ice baths after every game, lots of athletes do cryochambers, etc etc"
3285,Alex Duong,1600719314501,When you push your body to its highest limits everyday its gonna give in every now and then
3286,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600719317571,thatâs pretty reasonable
3287,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600719368664,"idk if it relates but ik that if a normal person tears their acl, they dont HAVE to get surgery on it, but i think thats more athletes need it to do their jons"
3288,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600719374847,jobs*
3289,Hursh Karkhanis,1600719384899,bruh even floyd mayweather did cryo chambers sometimes and his fights were easy as fuck for him
3290,Alex Duong,1600719399534,Torn acl takes 2 years for full recovery
3291,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600719427149,athletes speed that up bc rehab process?
3292,Alex Duong,1600719435795,With surgery + rehab in like 9 months ish you can train again
3293,Hursh Karkhanis,1600719520420,wait so saquan might never be saquan again?
3294,Alex Duong,1600719550965,Some players come back better
3295,Alex Duong,1600719554060,Adrian peterson

3432,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600753559331,"they COULD have tried a light ring on the interior though, around the circumference of the glass but since they have natural light coming in they don't need it"
3433,Aditya Vishwakarma,1600753660767,"i really don't like sofi stadium, they did the same shit as dolphins where they made it ""outdoors"" bc no walls connect to ceiling"

3436,Hursh Karkhanis,1600754135808,Isnât the Miami stadium new too? Or did they just remodel and rename
3437,Hursh Karkhanis,1600754161018,Used to be something else now itâs Hard Rock Stadium right
3438,Rishi Nair,1600754207826,Something like that yea

3455,Rishi Nair,1600852228426,Think he'd be up there if he won vs Pats
3456,Faizan Khan,1600852236850,he's top 15 borderline at best rn
3457,Rishi Nair,1600852242563,Which basically he did wasn't his fault Carroll stupid

3461,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600902644420,So many players are getting injured. Smh

3463,Rishi Nair,1600919349034,Sad to see
3464,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1600919389002,The Celtics effort is sadder
3465,Rishi Nair,1601081629972,Most athletic TE in the game wearing BD ðð
3466,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601081661969,This will be a fun week @Rishi Nair
3467,Rishi Nair,1601081684470,Frfr
3468,Rishi Nair,1601081693414,BB prolly try to take out Waller
3469,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601081780438,Idk Riggs is still the worst case for us
3470,Rishi Nair,1601081792899,Ruggs is out
3471,Alex Duong,1601081800240,Jacobs bigger threat
3472,Alex Duong,1601081801860,I think
3473,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601081806169,Ouch
3474,Rishi Nair,1601081806211,At any rate Waller's easily better
3475,Rishi Nair,1601081836168,Even if Ruggs played he's a rookie receiver w no preseason he and DC don't have all the chemistry down yet
3476,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601081902105,I meant to say that Riggs is the type of talent that u really canât gameplay for with the way our defense is while Jacobs and Waller can be nullified with certain situations
3477,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601081924939,"Heâs just too fast, if he figures it out then all heâll breaks loose"
3478,Rishi Nair,1601081935251,He will sooner than later
3479,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601081946270,Weâll see
3480,Rishi Nair,1601081950043,They're already solid just can't convert on every breakout play
3481,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601081957230,Interesting situation nonetheless
3482,Rishi Nair,1601081975051,Waller I think is on that level of hard to gameplan
3483,Rishi Nair,1601081982965,Guy's just a matchup nightmare
3484,Rishi Nair,1601081988449,Jacobs prob easiest to counter
3485,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601081998280,Heâs good but double coverage will shake him
3486,Rishi Nair,1601082004605,But he's also arguably the whole engine
3487,Rishi Nair,1601082014215,Saints had no answers
3488,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601082054349,They never do on defense cause their offense sets the pace but the absence of Thomas has messed up the flow of the team
3489,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601082079175,Defense is forced to be out there longer and theyâre not that good
3490,Rishi Nair,1601082091726,Yea this year D was supposed to be nice tho
3491,Rishi Nair,1601082100749,Previous years they were offense only
3492,Rishi Nair,1601082108525,Got bitched by us
3493,Rishi Nair,1601082131179,They got fucked by penalties Pats are way more disciplined

3495,Rishi Nair,1601082392363,I want the Oilers back

3497,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601082416945,"I want the Sonics back, it has to be Seattle"
3498,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601082446422,@Sharan Chakravarathy please take out saquon from ur lineup. Heâs out for the year
3499,Faizan Khan,1601082992466,oilers are just the titans

3515,Hursh Karkhanis,1601211307258,I was talking to my older cousin yesterday heâs super cool he told me his fantasy football league is a âlegacy leagueâ
3516,Hursh Karkhanis,1601211357454,"Where you draft once and then you get to keep certain players for a small fee, and every year the value of every player goes up by a small amount 2 bucks like an âinflationâ"
3517,Hursh Karkhanis,1601211395223,"I think they pay with 200 bucks but we can go smaller, idk seems kinda interesting he said itâs as close to real NFL team ownership as you can get"
3518,Hursh Karkhanis,1601211424608,What do u think @khanmissioner
3519,Hursh Karkhanis,1601211494698,Itâs called âdynasty leagueâ not legacy league **

3569,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601329701420,It seemed good when they thought they were going to the finals
3570,Aditya Vishwakarma,1601329771129,itâs just funny
3571,Aditya Vishwakarma,1601329804211,pg couldnât take a team past a rookie donovan mitchell and they still gave up all those pieces
3572,Alex Duong,1601329824131,they might regret losing SGA
3573,Alex Duong,1601329845508,but he was a non-negotiable inclusion that presti mandated be in the deal
3574,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601329932620,Ty Lue will take over as head coach
3575,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601329956817,I think this was in the works in for a while cause lue didnât interview for the Nets job
3576,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601329989039,I think this has been in the works for a while also clips donât wanna lose type lue
3577,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601330016705,Same thing would have happened with the lakers if they didnât reach the finals cause they like Jason Kidd
3578,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601330028831,So much happens in the off-season damn
3579,Aditya Vishwakarma,1601330167547,idt jason kidd gonna be our head coach
3580,Aditya Vishwakarma,1601330178528,lets see if ty lue is clippers tho
3581,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601330187806,Not anymore though
3582,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601330195409,Vogel got them to the finals
3583,Aditya Vishwakarma,1601330198515,vogel was on a 3 year contract anyways
3584,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601330219229,So was David blatt didnât matter

3586,Aditya Vishwakarma,1601330293473,glad he wasnt
3587,Aditya Vishwakarma,1601330299911,our defense wouldnt have been as good
3588,Aditya Vishwakarma,1601330321847,i think technically weâre the best defense in the bubble rn
3589,Aditya Vishwakarma,1601330327086,bc everyone else gone
3590,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601330379492,"Yup, good thing u clarified"

3597,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601348656234,Lamar doesnât look like an mvp
3598,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601348687960,Guess heâs only big time against bad teams
3599,Faizan Khan,1601348694868,we still comparing lamar to mahomes?
3600,Rishi Nair,1601348701815,https://twitter.com/BrettKollmann/status/1310757245915787264?s=19
3601,Rishi Nair,1601348709409,Nah only Russ
3602,Rishi Nair,1601348732791,Russ might be tied or 1b at worst
3603,Rishi Nair,1601348735699,Lamar 2
3604,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601348760978,"Mahomes, Russ, and then Lamar"
3605,Faizan Khan,1601348781335,yeah agree for now
3606,Faizan Khan,1601348792095,lets let lamar string together multiple elite seasons tho
3607,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601348793365,Well thatâs the rankings for now
3608,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601348800866,Itâs a fluid situation
3609,Rishi Nair,1601348812738,Just like my gender
3610,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601348829502,And the Raiders
3611,Rishi Nair,1601348849623,Fluid like the champagne we gnna be popping fr

3614,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601348894638,"Still gotta go the the playoffs, haven't done that often"
3615,Rishi Nair,1601349431588,This year fr
3616,Faizan Khan,1601349439995,"mahomes had combined 400 yards 5 tds, lamar 180 yds 1 td (98 yards passing)"
3617,Rishi Nair,1601349464091,Andrews sold
3618,Rishi Nair,1601349474356,Lamar should've had prob double the yards
3619,Faizan Khan,1601349529730,"oh, mark andrews dropped 180 yards worth of catches?"
3620,Rishi Nair,1601349648491,Yes
3621,Rishi Nair,1601349652320,Not just him tho

3626,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601349735748,Lamar can't play with the big boys
3627,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1601349743005,Proved his haters right
3628,Rishi Nair,1601349809358,I think between 2 and 5
3629,Faizan Khan,1601349809390,"lets see how he develops, but the way he was playing last year simply doesnt last"

4002,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602273682915,Dame is not overrated
4003,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602273686127,Can win with a lead but can't fight it out

4008,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602273712190,Lmao
4009,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602273735929,Giannis is the best comparison
4010,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602273742582,sure
4011,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602273747037,lets roll with that
4012,Faizan Khan,1602273774620,thats a bit disrespectful to giannis but sure closest thing
4013,Faizan Khan,1602273783470,giannis is way more established than lamar
4014,Faizan Khan,1602273829472,but the big game neutralize argument i can see
4015,Faizan Khan,1602274663249,wait just to be clear
4016,Faizan Khan,1602274666934,@Pavithran Konda Kumar
4017,Faizan Khan,1602274673803,did you say damian lillard cant win big games
4018,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602274711945,In the playoffs he struggles to advance the past the gameâs best
4019,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602274721070,Like Lebron and the splash brothers
4020,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602274753909,"Lamar is kinda like that, talented but I feel he wonât make progress in the playoffs in his career"
4021,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602274760155,Do that was my reasoning
4022,Hursh Karkhanis,1602275048670,i agree i think lebron and Rodgers were more individually skilled but brady and jordan had more team and organizational success
4023,Hursh Karkhanis,1602275093112,"also cleveland and greenbay small markets, chicago and new england bigger markets"
4024,Faizan Khan,1602275104488,"i dont think its as simple as ""team success"""
4025,Faizan Khan,1602275121482,they were more skilled but simply worse players
4026,Faizan Khan,1602275165725,but anyway point was the drop off is wayyyyy more steep for brady-rodgers than jordan-lebron
4027,Hursh Karkhanis,1602275237774,yeah agree
4028,Hursh Karkhanis,1602275258603,jordan lebron prob the closest sports debate in history
4029,Hursh Karkhanis,1602275311923,cant think of any baseball or football comparisons that are as close
4030,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602275432560,Barry bonds for a bit
4031,Faizan Khan,1602275434586,brady/manning was the biggest debate
4032,Faizan Khan,1602275469194,until brady was like
4033,Alex Duong,1602275517671,that gap would've closed so much if Peyton wins that sb against seattle
4034,Alex Duong,1602275531447,but that game was over by like
4035,Alex Duong,1602275536787,the 2nd q
4036,Faizan Khan,1602275562842,oh yeah mannning would've straight up been seen as better if he did
4037,Faizan Khan,1602275578330,but then brady would prob take it back with his 2014 and 2016
4038,Hursh Karkhanis,1602275581920,barry bonds is the greatest of all time but no one will ever say it because baseball culture still thinks their sport is clean when it clearly isnt
4039,Hursh Karkhanis,1602275615548,yeah manning dropped off/got hurt
4040,Hursh Karkhanis,1602275633573,second minute*
4041,Faizan Khan,1602275660568,/decided to age like a normal human being
4042,Alex Duong,1602275687647,I never understood why he was always the media darling
4043,Hursh Karkhanis,1602275707336,he was just a good ol american man
4044,Hursh Karkhanis,1602275712630,is*
4045,Alex Duong,1602275720564,his name prob helped some
4046,Hursh Karkhanis,1602275744395,brady is too elitist for regular americans with his avacado ice cream and aston matrin sponsorship
4047,Faizan Khan,1602275753240,eli >>>>
4048,Hursh Karkhanis,1602275776237,"peyton is more like: papa johns pizza, all state insurance, buick enclave"
4049,Hursh Karkhanis,1602275881438,"even brett farve: wrangler jeans, southern tough guy"
4050,Faizan Khan,1602275900948,i feel like in a way
4051,Faizan Khan,1602275912771,lebron's first half of his career was like peyton
4052,Faizan Khan,1602275938324,and 2nd half has been jordan ish
4053,Hursh Karkhanis,1602275950343,yeah i can see that
4054,Hursh Karkhanis,1602275970940,"big star small market, he's their hero"
4055,Hursh Karkhanis,1602275991934,and then hes like fuck you guys im getting some bling
4056,Faizan Khan,1602275997181,favre > rodgers dont @
4057,Alex Duong,1602276022113,hmm idk
4058,Alex Duong,1602276029798,depends if Rodgers gets a 2nd ring
4059,Alex Duong,1602276039627,but ppl forget what Favre was in the late 90s
4060,Faizan Khan,1602276047749,analytics people hate him
4061,Faizan Khan,1602276049647,hes like kobe
4062,Faizan Khan,1602276056854,rodgers is analytic fellows' darling
4063,Faizan Khan,1602276088930,but overall i think favre was better
4064,Faizan Khan,1602276115856,straight up numbers dont match bc era but i think favre was more dominant and for longer
4065,Faizan Khan,1602276237328,well rodgers absolute peak was better with his 2011 season
4066,Faizan Khan,1602276246683,but even that he choked in the playoffs
4067,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602305553861,fuck.

4074,Hursh Karkhanis,1602305633707,no he shoulda made that pass tho
4075,Hursh Karkhanis,1602305668881,or just taken it to the hole and forcing the heat to foul
4076,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602305708927,nah he had enough time and it's a good fast bounce pass
4077,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602305709639,he just panicked
4078,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602305710559,which is the forgivable part i guess
4079,Faizan Khan,1602306102079,jimmy's taking that and dunking it on the other end game over

4327,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602528290709,Also Dak isn't super close with Jerry Jones
4328,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602528300136,I hope things work out
4329,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602529550062,This is worrisome too
4330,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602529557064,He liked romo a lot more than he does dak
4331,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602529580232,"yeah, i think cowboys will give a two year deal to dak"
4332,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602529581837,And jones is v relationship focused
4333,Hursh Karkhanis,1602530889869,SAS talked about this today
4334,Hursh Karkhanis,1602530896416,damnit i just admitted i watched first take
4335,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602530907946,Thereâs no shame in that
4336,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602530915351,Hursh get out
4337,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602530933345,Itâs like someon admitting they watch buzzfeed
4338,Hursh Karkhanis,1602530998526,"i just think every sport talk show is very predictable except cowherd, thats why hes the only one i follow on youtube"
4339,Hursh Karkhanis,1602531017625,but i watched today for lakers stuff and then got sucked into the Dak stuff
4340,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602531063599,I think cowherd is p good w football
4341,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602531099076,Yes
4342,Hursh Karkhanis,1602531136761,ya i love him
4343,Hursh Karkhanis,1602531205077,i like his analogies and interesting takes is he always right? no. is he sometimes obnoxious? yes. but i like that hes unpredictable and unique
4344,Alex Duong,1602532051626,"Good for football,  ok ish for bball"
4345,Hursh Karkhanis,1602532054137,can someone please explain a franchise tag i don't really get it
4346,Alex Duong,1602532067121,Its like a yr deal
4347,Alex Duong,1602532090387,1 yr
4348,Alex Duong,1602532108847,For a player an org isn't sure they wanna commit long term to
4349,Alex Duong,1602532133411,"But if you tag them, they cant be a free agent"
4350,Alex Duong,1602532156428,So theres a dealine before free agency for teams to decide if they wanna tag a player
4351,Alex Duong,1602532165643,1 player per team
4352,Alex Duong,1602532286692,Basically you use it on a player you dont wanna lose but arent 100% committed to
4353,Alex Duong,1602532391239,Players dislike bc they lose they ability to get more $$ in free agency
4354,Hursh Karkhanis,1602532857020,so they are like locked
4355,Hursh Karkhanis,1602532863095,that sucks
4356,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602533044204,There is a thing called a transition tag and itâs more player friendly
4357,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602533063366,Itâs like a restricted free agent in basketball
4358,Faizan Khan,1602535720037,main issue with alex was infections so dak just has to get lucky and avoid those
4359,Faizan Khan,1602535744069,the early reports are that he'll only be out 4-6 months
4360,Rishi Nair,1602536425377,@Alex Duong ?
4361,Alex Duong,1602538436663,if i had alex smiths injury im done playing sports
4362,Alex Duong,1602538449415,that infection was life threatening
4363,Ameya Pandit,1602538458592,Iâm piping hoes and going into coaching fuck playing ball
4364,Alex Duong,1602538472143,thats basically what i did in hs
4365,Alex Duong,1602538478816,coaching was more fun
4366,Rishi Nair,1602538808241,https://twitter.com/TheHoopCentral/status/1315648708692766725?s=19
4367,Rishi Nair,1602538808510,Bruh
4368,Rishi Nair,1602538815972,Lowkey it's a possibility but they're not a 3peat caliber roster at all
4369,Rishi Nair,1602538829381,And also the comp will ramp up like tenfold
4370,Alex Duong,1602538841279,if they trade kuz for a 3rd star (highly unlikely)
4371,Rishi Nair,1602538854422,Kuz is the 3rd star no cap
4372,Alex Duong,1602538874950,i think when bron opts out after yr 3 he'll take less and they can get another guy
4373,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602538936039,free agency this year no cap
4374,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602538942469,and next obv
4375,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602538951204,we can def back to back it
4376,Rishi Nair,1602539371294,B2B or in like two years are the only likely scenarios I think
4377,Rishi Nair,1602539382783,Unless there's some weaker year down the line again

4390,Rishi Nair,1602542575654,Gogiii
4391,Ameya Pandit,1602542588357,i hope this denver team is more
4392,Ameya Pandit,1602542589590,golden state
4393,Ameya Pandit,1602542595808,than indiana from a few years ago
4394,Ameya Pandit,1602542612477,but jokic's left nut > hibbert
4395,Ameya Pandit,1602542620248,and murray _can_ be better than PG
4396,Rishi Nair,1602542622499,Deff more GS
4397,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602542640695,murray already better than pg bum ass
4398,Rishi Nair,1602542644612,I think they're in between Indy and us in terms of potential for sustained dominance
4399,Rishi Nair,1602542648540,Leaning towards us
4400,Rishi Nair,1602542653836,^
4401,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602542668083,tf u mean weaker year
4402,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602542673712,we're literally a top team in the nba
4403,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602542708401,i hope we DO 3 peat just to shut shit like that up
4404,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602542713940,i wanan see the excuses
4405,Rishi Nair,1602542760204,Y'all def a top team
4406,Rishi Nair,1602542773135,Top 3 but comp was relatively easy
4407,Rishi Nair,1602542779413,That's undeniable
4408,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602543228371,...
4409,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602543242284,"comp wasn't that easy, we were that good"
4410,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602543312302,"Portland injuries but we still would have beat them anyways 
Rockets LMAO 
denver beat the clippers, don't undermine them
miami beat the bucks, don't undermine them"
4411,Shripad Bangaru,1602543344158,I wish we got to see a fully healthy miami squad face yall
4412,Shripad Bangaru,1602543362421,Idk why they flopped so hard in game 6 tho
4413,Alex Duong,1602543370402,Gassed
4414,Hursh Karkhanis,1602543429798,You changed the group photo.
4415,Hursh Karkhanis,1602543493287,You changed the group photo.
4416,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602543700222,gassed plus good defense
4417,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602543725125,gassed made our defense look even better with the lead gap
4418,Rishi Nair,1602543732227,Bro
4419,Rishi Nair,1602543739812,Heat were 5 seed in the East
4420,Rishi Nair,1602543751742,Nuggets were also underdogs and weren't even supposed to be there
4421,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602543755088,5 seed that beat the best record team in the NBA?!
4422,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602543763356,tf u mean not supposed to be there
4423,Rishi Nair,1602543763387,How many teams pull off back to back 3-1 comebacks
4424,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602543771925,they literally beat the clear title favorites
4425,Rishi Nair,1602543782054,It's only cuz their competitors choked albeit full respect to them for making the comebacks
4426,Rishi Nair,1602543796067,But once it got to a real good team they got sent home fast
4427,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602543803942,competitors choked because the others played well
4428,Rishi Nair,1602543806630,Lakers def a good team I'm not saying they're bad
4429,Rishi Nair,1602543814414,This was almost a cakewalk tho
4430,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602543834668,"by that logic, clippers arenât a âreal good teamâ so your âhard competitionâ logic is invalid"
4431,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602543846273,literally contradicts itself
4432,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602543879136,literally what do u want
4433,Rishi Nair,1602543892450,Clippers weren't they choked
4434,Rishi Nair,1602543900917,They were a bunch of bum baby back bitches
4435,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602543903073,ok so who was supposed to beat us in teh west or the east
4436,Alex Duong,1602543909099,https://twitter.com/BleacherReport/status/1315480021302083584?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet
4437,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602543910299,"thatsâ not a cakewalk, thatâs just how good we are"
4438,Alex Duong,1602543912582,this was p funny ngl
4439,Rishi Nair,1602543915949,Mavs would've prolly even beaten them had KP not gone down
4440,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602543922955,this was a goat moment
4441,Rishi Nair,1602543927341,Idt it was a certified cakewalk
4442,Rishi Nair,1602543931227,I think it was close tho
4443,Rishi Nair,1602543944461,East was basically a cakewalk for Miami
4444,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602543956453,"the only reason u can say it was a cakewalk is because we were good, not becasue our competition wasnât âup to parâ"
4445,Rishi Nair,1602543985459,Def both but imo more the second
4446,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602543993749,if we had avery bradley with the healthy heat we still win that shit in 6
4447,Rishi Nair,1602544000600,"The ""break glass in case of emergency"" moment never even came"
4448,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544002257,that logic is so contradictory bruh
4449,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544004047,my goodness
4450,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544016402,bc u canât say clippers or other teams were gonna be hard for us and then say nah they choked so they bad
4451,Rishi Nair,1602544020605,Where like it demanded a monstrous performance out of Bron or AD to narrowly pull it out
4452,Rishi Nair,1602544085737,Cs were def more of a challenge
4453,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544086202,so 28ppg from AD with elite defense and near 30 point triple double every night isnât monstrous enough?
4454,Rishi Nair,1602544092873,Bucks was the real cake
4455,Rishi Nair,1602544109225,Bruh AD literally had multiple games of sub 25
4456,Rishi Nair,1602544116856,This wasn't a hard chip lmao
4457,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544121968,oh my god
4458,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544126821,there is literally no getting thru to u
4459,Rishi Nair,1602544127029,The bubble conditions were harder
4460,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544128025,fuck this
4461,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544132005,think what u want
4462,Rishi Nair,1602544138850,That's ok
4463,Rishi Nair,1602544149571,I hear ur arg too
4464,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544150541,not really bc your logic is flawed as fuck but im not debating it anymore
4465,Alex Duong,1602544167960,im like 50% sure rishi is just meming
4466,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544174362,iâm still more triggered about being kicked outta class
4467,Rishi Nair,1602544176940,I'm not
4468,Rishi Nair,1602544183413,It's not like it was uber easy
4469,Rishi Nair,1602544193507,I think close to cakewalk
4470,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544195406,"heâs not meming, if he memes heâll include one or two clearlyt blashpemous statements"
4471,Rishi Nair,1602544206596,Forsure some minimal adversity otw
4472,Rishi Nair,1602544224397,Otherwise role players bumming half the time and they're still winning handily
4473,Rishi Nair,1602544241854,It's not even really how good the team is so much as how dominant Bron and AD are
4474,Rishi Nair,1602544251525,Lakers did have good defense tho forsure
4475,Rishi Nair,1602544262639,Props to the players and Vogel scheming
4476,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544279389,did u not see how easily we steamrolled every single team witih our versatility... dwight and AD on jokic was brutal despite stats
4477,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544292495,"rockets are a fucking joke 
we sonned the blazers too"
4478,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602544301073,Lmao ignore rishi
4479,Rishi Nair,1602544301397,Forsure matchups were well exploited too yea
4480,Rishi Nair,1602544311877,Wait didn't faiz literally agree w me
4481,Rishi Nair,1602544339324,I'm not even tryna disrespect Lakers it's just true like y'all beat a Heat team w Jimmy Butler and a bunch of young guys
4482,Rishi Nair,1602544382691,"Nuggets outperformed what they were supposed to and the SINGLE BIGGEST on paper threat, Clippers, whom many had chalked up to win it or at minimum kill in the WCF"
4483,Rishi Nair,1602544386587,Absolutely disappeared
4484,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602544391577,Y r we making fu of the heat. They proved they belong as one of the top teams in the league.
4485,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544398225,"he just doesnât want to give us the full credit, itâs easy to say that when u donât watch every game"
4486,Rishi Nair,1602544404870,Def def
4487,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544408008,by saying itâs a cakewalk ur undermining the heat
4488,Rishi Nair,1602544412219,They were still obviously outgunned
4489,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544427550,so u supporting them and dickriding jimmy is kinda counterproductive
4490,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544436507,when u say shit like cakewalk
4491,Rishi Nair,1602544438146,10ppg from 2nd best player?
4492,Rishi Nair,1602544445111,Jimmy is one guy
4493,Hursh Karkhanis,1602544445275,"instead of debating on this endless topic with no answer in sight, i prefer to debate something more definitive and objective

for example:

question: who are the two best pornstars
answer: nicole aniston and jessa rhodes"
4494,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602544448927,Wins donât lie
4495,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602544457687,They made the finals end of story
4496,Rishi Nair,1602544459501,Game 3 alone he did far more than he needed to
4497,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544470023,facts\
4498,Rishi Nair,1602544474574,Wait also this chip is fully valid to me
4499,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544478513,"made it to the finals, u belong there"
4500,Rishi Nair,1602544481097,Like I think Toronto chip was kinda bs
4501,Rishi Nair,1602544490733,They beat our hospital squad
4502,Rishi Nair,1602544509267,I even acknowledge how our 2015 chip benefitted from big injuries
4503,Rishi Nair,1602544512368,Love and Kyrie
4504,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544530367,okay but heat bench a lot more consistent than our bench...
4505,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602544537311,Lmao every championship has an asterisk
4506,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544545959,factual
4507,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544556441,nah this is subjective too

4516,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544718794,she is good looking tho
4517,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544726406,yes

4520,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602544937625,we are one and the same
4521,Rishi Nair,1602545039300,Depends
4522,Rishi Nair,1602545072128,15 for ex while they had injuries sure we were still a super dominant team all around from stars to one of the greatest bench mobs of all time
4523,Rishi Nair,1602545078410,So I take it w a grain of salt
4524,Rishi Nair,1602545108218,16 sure there were suspensions and it was more on us for choking but I give Bron his props for making the comeback
4525,Rishi Nair,1602545148546,KD was like a walking fucking asterisk
4526,Rishi Nair,1602545151653,Fuck that guy
4527,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602545320395,how about we just appreciate every championship bc every team worked hard as fuck for it
4528,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602545334448,even KD and warriors

4612,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602548906390,one of the best screenwriters of all time
4613,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602557996158,Best movie of 2011
4614,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602559685119,Never Say Never with Justin Bieber literally exists...
4615,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602559772385,jk so far Limitless or Midnight In Paris are my favs so far from 2011
4616,Faizan Khan,1602559875681,i tried watching midnight in paris but it was so boring
4617,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602559882579,Yes
4618,Faizan Khan,1602559888472,couldn't get past like 1/4
4619,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602559941329,It was too low stakes great beginning but disappointing climax
4620,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602559984796,BRUH
4621,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602559992883,that movie is sooo good
4622,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602560007370,I wish I agreed with u
4623,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602560015242,it wasn't about the stakes as much as it was just about the guy
4624,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602560036264,it was more of a love letter to paris than it was like a super conflict driven movie
4625,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602560042757,2008 is all that matters because of The Dark Knight
4626,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602560053398,that was evidenced by like the 5 minute shots of the streets of paris in the beginning
4627,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602560057130,FACTS
4628,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602560066174,best comic book movie all time
4629,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602560115964,I believe itâs the best of all time because at its core it was a movie about a superhero not a superhero movie
4630,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602560148782,yeah it actually had super high stakes and joker was perfectly written as well as performed
4631,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602560154663,he always one step ahead of batman
4632,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602560174340,Health ledger gave the performance of a lifetime

4721,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602580763926,and they couldn't just run to get a FG bc they'd still be down 1
4722,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602580770870,But theres less chance chiefs score
4723,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602580788690,Also idk the chiefs play better zone coverage than run defense

4763,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602581327708,goddamn i thought the sharks won a few stanley cups what the fuck
4764,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602581340156,This might be a weird comparison but he reminds me of prime drose
4765,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602581358319,17 MLB and 28 in total if you count As for Bay Area
4766,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602581363978,LOL what
4767,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602581366653,But younger
4768,Ameya Pandit,1602581376958,oakland's won a few
4769,Ameya Pandit,1602581388898,(yes i know they're LVR now)
4770,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602581398499,Drose was the best pg and mvp and had a shot to make the finals
4771,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602581410898,Also he was the most athletic point guard ever
4772,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602581414148,yeah i don't count raiders anymore :( but theyve won like 5 right
4773,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602581414503,Outside of Westbrook
4774,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602581427779,80s shit
4775,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602581446480,"ah ur talking like record wise rn, and lamar has the hurdle of mahomes, rose had the hurdle of bron"
4776,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602581462697,"idt lamar's the best qb tho, sorry ameya :("
4777,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602581465702,And it was interesting bc point guards are supposed to rely on skillset/iq rather than athleticism and yet rose and lamar use that to their advantage
4778,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602581466464,mahomes
4779,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602581479134,good point yeah
4780,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602581481440,Yeah objectively speaking lamar isnt number 1 qb
4781,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602581506712,And it's literally bc hes competing w arguably the most talented qb ever
4782,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602581547860,Its like prime drose vs prime steph
4783,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602581557719,Or lebron sure lmao
4784,Aditya Vishwakarma,1602581661627,yeah i see ur logic lool
4785,Rishi Nair,1602581849685,ð
4786,Rishi Nair,1602581877577,Lamar had Rose's impact last year reg season but nowhere near close in playoffs
4787,Rishi Nair,1602581884710,Now even reg season is like post injury rose
4788,Rishi Nair,1602581894659,Which isn't terrible but not superstar
4789,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602581925870,I mean rose also disappointed in playoffs
4790,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602581933761,He only won 1 game against the heat
4791,Faizan Khan,1602583156444,aiyuk is an upgrade even as a rookie tbh
4792,Faizan Khan,1602583168832,sanders is whatever at this point
4793,Faizan Khan,1602583183257,wtf they were completely overmatched
4794,Faizan Khan,1602583213962,how is rose supposed to beat 3 top 10 players and 2 top 3
4795,Faizan Khan,1602583226589,rose was a great playoff performer
4796,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602583242579,Oh im not saying it was his fault
4797,Rishabh Swarnkar,1602583253263,I shouldve ssid the bulls* disappointed

4810,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602607455905,Knicks are the gift that keeps giving
4811,Alex Duong,1602614150125,New york has like 50 titles
4812,Alex Duong,1602614159820,but they have two teams in each sport
4813,Alex Duong,1602614170634,yankees carrying with 27
4814,Hursh Karkhanis,1602614532917,the thing with the Yanks is so many of their titles are from a different era like they have 1 ring in the last 19-20 years
4815,Alex Duong,1602614544014,mhmm
4816,Alex Duong,1602614557317,they had like a golden generation in the late 90s
4817,Hursh Karkhanis,1602614579051,red sox the much better modern franchise they have like 4 rings right?
4818,Cole Quinn,1602614595052,modern yankees arenât great. 1 ring in 20 years
4819,Alex Duong,1602614596030,yup 03 07 13 18
4820,Hursh Karkhanis,1602614605895,"exactly, boston much better"
4821,Cole Quinn,1602614611719,agreed
4822,Hursh Karkhanis,1602614630288,i think boston and oakland might be my two fav AL teams
4823,Hursh Karkhanis,1602614644824,but not gonna lie i like the yanks too but thats more of their city lmao
4824,Alex Duong,1602614649816,ah the two teams that started analytics
4825,Alex Duong,1602614656769,or started using it rather
4826,Hursh Karkhanis,1602614658981,HAHAHA YEAH
4827,Alex Duong,1602614690816,it the A's actually spent money
4828,Alex Duong,1602614697701,they wouldve prob had a title
4829,Hursh Karkhanis,1602614754333,yeah they deserve one
4830,Hursh Karkhanis,1602614778317,who are your guy's fav NL teams
4831,Alex Duong,1602614824243,i think the giants are the only correct answer
4832,Alex Duong,1602614840071,"jk idk i change around, i like what the braves are doing rn"
4833,Hursh Karkhanis,1602614852436,braves good yeah
4834,Alex Duong,1602614861919,couple yrs ago i liked the cubs
4835,Alex Duong,1602614867888,i thought theyd win more than 1 title
4836,Hursh Karkhanis,1602614876790,hahahah
4837,Hursh Karkhanis,1602614890357,i like their players like Baez and Bryant
4838,Hursh Karkhanis,1602614895676,and Heyward
4839,Hursh Karkhanis,1602614924525,if i was a player i'd wanna play in the NL east tbh
4840,Hursh Karkhanis,1602614941180,"you get to travel to Atlanta, DC, new York, Miami and Philly like all the time"
4841,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602614953592,Wouldn't it be funny if the Astros won this year?
4842,Hursh Karkhanis,1602614954269,prob the best collection of cities in a division in baseball
4843,Hursh Karkhanis,1602615023335,worst prob AL central bc they have cleveland and detroit lmao but they have chicago too
4844,Alex Duong,1602615049136,Nl west good too
4845,Alex Duong,1602615053200,Except arizona
4846,Hursh Karkhanis,1602615082449,"SF, LA, SD, Denver, Phoenix yeah"
4847,Hursh Karkhanis,1602615106091,"arizona plays in a dome since its like 100+ in summer there, they have a pool inside the stadium"
4848,Hursh Karkhanis,1602615185194,apparently PNC park is just as nice as oracle park or fenway @Faizan Khan
4849,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615204448,The stadium that matters is the one by the bay
4850,Alex Duong,1602615249698,Didnt the giants used to play at candlestick
4851,Alex Duong,1602615253829,Like a looong time ago
4852,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615260266,in the 70s
4853,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615265243,long time ago
4854,Hursh Karkhanis,1602615290899,it got kinda dangerous bc that tiny rock hard ball flying around + wind
4855,Hursh Karkhanis,1602615308410,not to mention C O L D
4856,Hursh Karkhanis,1602615425087,@Pavithran Konda Kumar the texas rangers ballpark is brand spanking new i think the world series bubble gonna be there this year
4857,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615479473,I know about that place but no one in dallas really cares
4858,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615501038,the old stadium was nice now arlington is stuck with more taxes
4859,Hursh Karkhanis,1602615552102,oh damn publicly financed :(
4860,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615577892,"Yeah, no jerry jones to do it"
4861,Hursh Karkhanis,1602615616002,lol they building the new one right next to the old one HAHA
4862,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615631825,Stupidest thing ever
4863,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615638880,So unecessary
4864,Cole Quinn,1602615655115,the old park was still nice i donât get the reason for a new one
4865,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615661845,amen
4866,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615698808,If anything we should have built more train stations to help with transportation to cowboys games
4867,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615716879,instead another stadium to replace a perfectly good one
4868,Hursh Karkhanis,1602615719625,is there no (good) public transit now?
4869,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615725120,no
4870,Alex Duong,1602615743920,Isnt arlington like an hr from dallas
4871,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615746273,jerry jones chose arlington cause theres a lot of land and then he could charge a lot for parking
4872,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615759157,"yeah, its like 30 min"
4873,Alex Duong,1602615767802,I see
4874,Alex Duong,1602615791512,Attendance will never be a problem for the cowboys tho
4875,Hursh Karkhanis,1602615793377,pure business man
4876,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615827465,jerry jones wanted to build in place of the current cotton bowl but the poor people in the area complained about taxes
4877,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615834882,so it moved from dallas to arlington
4878,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615839295,but that spot was working
4879,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615847092,so perfect *
4880,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615853815,downtown with train station
4881,Hursh Karkhanis,1602615887203,yeah i always thought stadiums in convenient locations were cooler and practical
4882,Hursh Karkhanis,1602615905384,good for the downtown businesses too (not that they need it LOL)
4883,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615908711,most stadiums are but they typically have good transport
4884,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615916443,dallas is atrocious in that regard
4885,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615941548,u gotta pay 30 dollars to park 2 miles away from the stadium
4886,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615943303,rip
4887,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602615951384,not for the cowboys
4888,Hursh Karkhanis,1602615995546,god fucking damn it
4889,Hursh Karkhanis,1602616003003,do they have shuttles at least
4890,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602616007057,no
4891,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602616013334,but they have pavement to walk
4892,Hursh Karkhanis,1602616019305,LMAOOOOOOOOO
4893,Hursh Karkhanis,1602616059788,ok i didnt know that i always thought cowboys stadium was this amazing football top of the line experience (it prob is on the inside)
4894,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602616099864,once u get there its amazing
4895,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602616113788,but transport in and out is annoying unless u got 300 dollars
4896,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602616196083,some people uber from the closest train station so it is possible if u have money
4897,Alex Duong,1602616229065,dont uber prices spike on game day
4898,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602616233806,yes
4899,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602616240241,all part of the plan
4900,Alex Duong,1602616248213,i remember ameya and I tried to get one to la coliseum from ucla
4901,Alex Duong,1602616260943,initially it was like $60 or something
4902,Hursh Karkhanis,1602616349243,i think its called Congestion pricing right?
4903,Alex Duong,1602616391635,yea i think
4904,Alex Duong,1602616421628,downtown LA traffic + gameday = no bueno
4905,Hursh Karkhanis,1602616432385,new Yankee Stadium (2009) was built right across the old one and its kinda inconvenient but its still one subway away from Manhattan or BKLN or Queens
4906,Hursh Karkhanis,1602616438133,but they needed a new one like
4907,Hursh Karkhanis,1602616448111,i saw a video of the old one by this guy i follow on youtube
4908,Hursh Karkhanis,1602616479104,"this was during a non crowded game, narrow hallways and just dingy"
4909,Hursh Karkhanis,1602616499191,imagine if the Red Sox or Mets were in town it would be impossible to walk around
4910,Alex Duong,1602616570408,how can one grow up in new york and be a mets fan
4911,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602616586933,If u lived in queens
4912,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602616594686,Long island
4913,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1602616605513,Not everyone in New York is a Yankees fan
4914,Hursh Karkhanis,1602616630174,yeah queens people and also just family lineage
4915,Hursh Karkhanis,1602616652997,i mean lets be honest the Mets have been in a WS more recently (2015) than the Yanks (2009)
4916,Hursh Karkhanis,1602616665343,but the yanks would have if not for the cheating astros
4917,Hursh Karkhanis,1602616732611,"aaron judge would have like two rings by now, 2017 and 2019 (both years lost to cheating astros in ALCS) bc they would have beat the dodgers and they would have killed the nationals"
4918,Alex Duong,1602616749217,eh idk
4919,Alex Duong,1602616763485,dodgers shoulda had em in game 5 of 2017
4920,Hursh Karkhanis,1602616778363,is that the alex bregman game
4921,Alex Duong,1602616794529,then yu darvish happened
4922,Alex Duong,1602616796189,in game 7
4923,Alex Duong,1602616805522,(albeit astros prob knew what was coming)
4924,Hursh Karkhanis,1602616820682,thats still one of the greatest games ever i think game 5
4925,Hursh Karkhanis,1602616846528,bro he posted an apology video recently after all the astors shit came out
4926,Hursh Karkhanis,1602616859022,bc he became a low-level meme after 2017 game 7
4927,Hursh Karkhanis,1602616913716,mets were recently bought by some dude i hope they are good again
4928,Alex Duong,1602617006849,rn arent they just jacob degrom and not much else

5225,Hursh Karkhanis,1603575787814,latest episode about Dak and contracts ^
5226,Aditya Vishwakarma,1603576423945,wasnt dak the one who wanted like 900M per minute played or something
5227,Aditya Vishwakarma,1603576427452,or was that zeke
5228,Rishi Nair,1603576515720,Prolly 90
5229,Rishi Nair,1603576518767,900 impossible
5230,Aditya Vishwakarma,1603576954411,yeah sarcasm
5231,Hursh Karkhanis,1603577127156,they shoulda paid him i mean whats the point in waiting
5232,Hursh Karkhanis,1603577142466,its not like youre gonna move off him (this is pre injury)
5233,Alex Duong,1603577145877,They could had him for a bargain a few yrs ago
5234,Alex Duong,1603577158553,But idk they were hoping his price would go down
5235,Alex Duong,1603577164741,Instead its gone up
5236,Hursh Karkhanis,1603577187246,so they were hoping he would play bad for them???
5237,Hursh Karkhanis,1603577204311,"bc like hs on your team why are you hoping his price goes down, at best you hope it stays the same"
5238,Alex Duong,1603577255635,I think in their last negotiations they agreed on like 38 mil per yr or something
5239,Alex Duong,1603577268836,But he wanted 5 yrs the cowboys offered 4
5240,Alex Duong,1603577274178,Or something
5241,Hursh Karkhanis,1603577279942,ohh okay
5242,Alex Duong,1603577296362,Boys mismanaged this
5243,Hursh Karkhanis,1603577302842,"i can see why thats a point of contention, 5 years vs 4"
5244,Rishi Nair,1603577308981,5 years is literally better for them
5245,Rishi Nair,1603577315843,If same money
5246,Hursh Karkhanis,1603577364829,bruh whats the point in cutting off a year its not like they have some new QB in the works whos being groomed
5247,Hursh Karkhanis,1603577377733,i guess they could draft one in the next 4 drafts??
5248,Faizan Khan,1603577383762,No dak wanted less
5249,Faizan Khan,1603577386976,Years
5250,Hursh Karkhanis,1603577393009,why
5251,Alex Duong,1603577404258,Bc in 4 yrs he can renegotiate
5252,Faizan Khan,1603577405896,Bc qb salaries inflate like crazy as time goes
5253,Alex Duong,1603577408475,For more money
5254,Faizan Khan,1603577429384,Also idk the guarantees they offered
5255,Hursh Karkhanis,1603577443110,oh gotcha
5256,Faizan Khan,1603577486610,I feel if it was normal guarantees he shoulda just taken it but they mustâve been low
5257,Faizan Khan,1603577497903,Otherwise idk why heâd turn down 35
5258,Rishi Nair,1603577627189,Didn't he straight up just want 40
5259,Alex Duong,1603577730876,Cowboys losing this division would give dak a lot more leverage
5260,Alex Duong,1603577767740,Uh oh
5261,Hursh Karkhanis,1603577853959,lmao
5262,Hursh Karkhanis,1603577882410,bruh i saw a clip of the lakers at some party for winning the ring and a lot of them didnt have masks lol
5263,Rishi Nair,1603578099221,At least they won a ring
5264,Rishi Nair,1603578108131,And not their first reg season game in week 7
5265,Hursh Karkhanis,1603578395784,lmaooo
5266,Aditya Vishwakarma,1603578783809,bad lebron
5267,Aditya Vishwakarma,1603578817474,we hang championship banners not opening day and Christmas day W banners
5268,Aditya Vishwakarma,1603578865939,but dont the cowboys have leverage with the re-injury concerns?
5269,Aditya Vishwakarma,1603578883351,idk how NFL contracts work
5270,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603578920985,He would have leverage cause the team has been shit without him
5271,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603578932899,But the injury will kill a huge and long deal
5272,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603578954534,Best case is another team or a 2 year deal with the boys
5273,Faizan Khan,1603578971862,I donât think injury will matter much for that
5274,Faizan Khan,1603578977689,Heâs a pocket passer mainly
5275,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603578982695,Alex Smith
5276,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603578986762,I rest my case
5277,Faizan Khan,1603578991274,I think theyâll pay him if they were gonna and wonât if they wonât
5278,Faizan Khan,1603578997724,What about him lol
5279,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603579003858,Fantastic
5280,Faizan Khan,1603579007604,Alex smithâs situation was wayyyyyyyyyyy worse
5281,Alex Duong,1603579009760,Alex smith had a life threatening infection tho
5282,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603579015023,They shouldnât pay him
5283,Faizan Khan,1603579018361,He had life threatening infections from his surgeries
5284,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603579024486,Better off with a rebuild
5285,Faizan Khan,1603579030017,And also we donât even know how good heâll be when he comes back
5286,Faizan Khan,1603579036745,And Dak is also younger and better than smith
5287,Alex Duong,1603579038222,Colin was sayinf this
5288,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603579039840,Cowboys suck and lot of players are overpaid
5289,Faizan Khan,1603579051034,So I donât get the comparison
5290,Alex Duong,1603579053447,Demarcus lawrence took the money and ran
5291,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603579058016,The team was barely winning with him
5292,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603579071632,What makes u think they will be better next year ?
5293,Faizan Khan,1603579094922,Eh I donât think they should go in a total rebuild
5294,Faizan Khan,1603579099633,Their o line is decimated this year
5295,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603579105517,Thatâs true
5296,Faizan Khan,1603579106483,Thatâs the biggest reason for sucking
5297,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603579117459,But I gotta pay day like 40 mil then
5298,Faizan Khan,1603579122101,And also installing a new system in a pandemic offseason
5299,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603579124457,Idk if Jerry is doing that
5300,Alex Duong,1603579125432,Their defense cant stop anything
5301,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603579149770,So how Will paying dak help that ?
5302,Faizan Khan,1603579159306,Thatâs fair u can go both ways I just donât think the injury effects it much
5303,Faizan Khan,1603579199722,Their front office has been absolutely bone headed past few years
5304,Alex Duong,1603579210297,Jerry is the front office
5305,Alex Duong,1603579216139,Stephen too
5306,Faizan Khan,1603579221518,Theyâre good at drafting but bad at contracts
5307,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603579230856,Exactly
5308,Alex Duong,1603579239255,I think they need to get a real gm but jerry wouldnt do that
5309,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603579241369,Jerry needs to let his ego go
5310,Alex Duong,1603579243771,He likes to be hands on
5311,Alex Duong,1603579246589,On everything
5312,Faizan Khan,1603579247896,They overpaid copper like a motherfucker then drafted ceedee as a luxury item when they had massive holes on the D
5313,Faizan Khan,1603579254113,Cooper*
5314,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603579255551,Yup
5315,Faizan Khan,1603579279169,Demarcus Lawrence got crazy money and has been irrelevant since
5316,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603579285498,Basically
5317,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603579300308,Robert Quinn was the best pass rusher last year
5318,Faizan Khan,1603579314037,And Aldon this year lol
5319,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603579327649,Interesting
5320,Aditya Vishwakarma,1603580590805,"yeah this was what i was referring to more, u said it better"
5321,Alex Duong,1603581216073,Poverty franchise
5322,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603581293750,Lot of teams announced cuts
5323,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603581309488,Aâs just are on the lower end of the league
5324,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603581325695,They never should have settled in Oakland
5325,Aditya Vishwakarma,1603581597044,"after having watched Moneyball, I will not accept this disrespect"
5326,Hursh Karkhanis,1603581603029,"expected, they probably have the least cash on hand of all teams :("

5335,Alex Duong,1603581794449,oakland has money for a new stadium?
5336,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603581826400,They should move to Portland or Utah

5431,Aditya Vishwakarma,1603685439860,"their defense is cheeks tho i saw some highlights, made baker look like thomas brady"
5432,Faizan Khan,1603685478034,Heâs promising but yeah the team is horrible
5433,Faizan Khan,1603685500625,The chargers rookie Justin Herbert looks even better
5434,Alex Duong,1603740165770,Ah... weve come a long way
5435,Hursh Karkhanis,1603740720522,man been proving people wrong for TWENTY years
5436,Hursh Karkhanis,1603740746815,"drafted when he was our age (22-23), now he's 43"
5437,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603740773000,He finally admitted he was wrong
5438,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603740784342,He stuck to that crap for 4 years
5439,Hursh Karkhanis,1603741090902,he didnt even have a reason to feel that way right? like brady was never bad it was just the pats that one year
5440,Alex Duong,1603741091717,Where rob parker at
5441,Alex Duong,1603741113365,ð¤¡
5442,Hursh Karkhanis,1603741166936,bro pats made the super bowl three of the four years we were in college
5443,Hursh Karkhanis,1603741171851,and they won two of those^
5444,Alex Duong,1603741217175,51 was my fav
5445,Faizan Khan,1603741270393,Somehow this dude dominated the NFL in our early childhood and all of college
5446,Faizan Khan,1603741271926,Tf
5447,Faizan Khan,1603741320099,Heâll prob retire after his contract 2022 ?
5448,Alex Duong,1603741336890,He'll retire when no team wants to sign him
5449,Alex Duong,1603741340852,As a starter
5450,Alex Duong,1603741368908,Unless gisele steps in and forces him too
5451,Hursh Karkhanis,1603741382667,i have a question: is he better this year than last or is he like the same (but still great)
5452,Faizan Khan,1603741399640,Heâs better but he has a way better supporting cast
5453,Alex Duong,1603741401991,"Same i think, just better pieces around him"
5454,Faizan Khan,1603741403724,So it might just be that
5455,Alex Duong,1603741531325,Tbh i thought hed be more of a game manager this yr
5456,Alex Duong,1603741542921,But hes still slinging
5457,Faizan Khan,1603741871026,Heâs like top 10 again I think
5458,Alex Duong,1603741878281,Ya fair
5459,Hursh Karkhanis,1603742142558,thats amazing
5460,Hursh Karkhanis,1603742159485,i gotta watch some TB Buccaneers games
5461,Alex Duong,1603742169854,Their defense is raw
5462,Alex Duong,1603742192767,If offense can stay top 10 theyll be legit contenders

5477,Faizan Khan,1603750639563,now hes gonna have to come off an ACL too
5478,Faizan Khan,1603750654630,i think he needs a new team also

5507,Hursh Karkhanis,1603823080900,i just had this weird realization that everything that is relevant/important in this world happens in cycles
5508,Hursh Karkhanis,1603823089042,***no i am not high***
5509,Hursh Karkhanis,1603823139964,"but everything whether its big: weather cycle (4 seasons), economic cycle (expansion vs contraction)"
5510,Hursh Karkhanis,1603823152269,or small: like a womans' period cycle
5511,Hursh Karkhanis,1603823155945,is a cycle
5512,Rishi Nair,1603823186801,Or a Vithoba cycle
5513,Hursh Karkhanis,1603823214508,i think even testosterone in men is a small mini cycle thru the day but im not sure about that i just heard it in a ted talk
5514,Hursh Karkhanis,1603823344852,also unrelated but i never bothered to ask why do india and china have so many people

5524,Rishi Nair,1603834077956,My dad had 7 sibs
5525,Rishi Nair,1603834104590,Partly bc of the culture and era calling for bigger families but also due to lesser knowledge of contraception lmfaoo
5526,Aditya Vishwakarma,1603834126303,Yeah my dad had 4 other siblings
5527,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603834148793,Also fewer opportunities for women. That played a role in society much more than today
5528,Rishi Nair,1603834205840,Yea his mom only had like a 4th grade education or something I think
5529,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603834274353,Makes sense my grandmothers had about the same
5530,Rishi Nair,1603834312700,My mom's mom worked in the fisheries dept for the govt tho think she went to college too but not sure
5531,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1603834329600,She probably did
5532,Hursh Karkhanis,1603834368365,i googled it and it said it was bc they needed lots of people to claim agricultural land but thats just from Quora its not a trusted source LOL
5533,Rishi Nair,1603834382764,Also my dad's mom is 20 years older than mom's
5534,Rishi Nair,1603834398569,And my dad was the youngest kid born when his dad was like 56 I think
5535,Hursh Karkhanis,1603834405388,"also

1)lesser knowledge of contraception
2) fewer opportunities for women

5665,Hursh Karkhanis,1604300823492,only new york fans would have the creativity and passion to do this
5666,Hursh Karkhanis,1604300886561,they literally chant everyones name (except pitcher and catcher) in the first inning until they look back and wave at the crowd
5667,Aditya Vishwakarma,1604300923598,"what's the ""bleacher creature"""
5668,Hursh Karkhanis,1604300943971,its just the name of the fans who sit in the right field bleachers

5672,Alex Duong,1604348690261,Burrow looks raw tho
5673,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1604348763712,"i agree with that statement, lamar is a great talent but he still hasn't developed as a passer. Who knows if he ever will"
5674,Faizan Khan,1604348767779,Not a hot take at all lol
5675,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1604348773206,we all remember kapernick
5676,Hursh Karkhanis,1604348776242,You set your nickname to Hursh Ochocinco.
5677,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1604348788094,he flamed out as a star before being blacklisted
5678,Faizan Khan,1604348917429,Lamar decline wonât be as drastic tho bc his intangibles are much better than Kap
5679,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1604348927733,tru
5680,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1604348953707,but burrow has a chance to become better than lamar and that was cowherd's point
5681,Faizan Khan,1604348969005,Oh thereâs no question
5682,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1604348976543,"he doesn't deal in facts, its all about takes. either u agree or u dont"

5694,Hursh Karkhanis,1604349367501,"not saying they are racist bc they re republican, im saying like they are actually racist independent of political party"
5695,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1604349381304,People in Austin though are republicans and arenât racist. For the most part
5696,Hursh Karkhanis,1604349387737,thats good
5697,Hursh Karkhanis,1604349402066,yeah prob just economic reasons

5702,Hursh Karkhanis,1604349610497,@Faizan Khan tell me if this is accurate or not but im 99% sure islam is a peaceful religion and all the terrirosts who bomb/hijack shit are just brainwashed by people saying this is what god wants right??? and most of these people are poor and they are told if you go hijack this plane we will give your family money
5703,Faizan Khan,1604349731355,Yes
5704,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1604349786855,The 26/11 dudes were poor dudes who did it for the money
5705,Faizan Khan,1604349845873,Idk about the poor part but these groups just want power
5706,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1604349873580,"Islam is not based in hate, thatâs just bs invented by hateful people seeking power and money"
5707,Faizan Khan,1604350042900,"No religion itself is ever to blame, itâs just that human beings always looking for divisions and power so theyâll use whatever to do so- religion/race/gender/sects/etc"
5708,Hursh Karkhanis,1604350079227,hella true
5709,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1604350110447,Religion was invented to control people through moral standards but has been manipulated too many times throughout history

6242,Aditya Vishwakarma,1605654693329,my parents are evidence enough that arranged marriges and the astrologers that predict matches and shit are bullshit
6243,Aditya Vishwakarma,1605654711469,iâd rather be single than get an arranged marriage at this point in life
6244,Hursh Karkhanis,1605654887670,mine too
6245,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1605654935931,Yâall need to chill. No ones forcing yâall into arranged marriages. You guys arenât 24 year women
6246,Hursh Karkhanis,1605654948808,IK we not saying that
6247,Hursh Karkhanis,1605654953928,twas just a question
6248,Hursh Karkhanis,1605654999767,bc how are u gonna know someones personality and tendencies and moods on meeting #3
6249,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1605655069825,"According to conservatives, all u need is to try a store bought samosa and you can judge a person entirely"
6250,Aditya Vishwakarma,1605655381763,"this is what we feel at this time, opinions and points of view change as we get older"
6251,Aditya Vishwakarma,1605655392795,one can only speak from experience
6252,Hursh Karkhanis,1605655800586,bro in america theres tons of unmarried people who are 30+ like thats NORMAL
6253,Hursh Karkhanis,1605655809000,we ment arent even fully developed till 25
6254,Hursh Karkhanis,1605655811760,mentally
6255,Hursh Karkhanis,1605655816312,men*
6256,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1605655838855,27 is like the best time to get married though
6257,Hursh Karkhanis,1605655854225,hard to be that specific and pick one age
6258,Hursh Karkhanis,1605655881992,also depends i guess on how long u wanna be together before marriage
6259,Hursh Karkhanis,1605655905277,some wanna be together for like 6 years before marriage some want to be together for like 1.5 lol
6260,Hursh Karkhanis,1605656053869,i do think 27-28 is a good age to MEET and start dating the girl you eventually end up marrying
6261,Hursh Karkhanis,1605656364386,You changed the chat theme to Maple.
6262,Alex Duong,1605656908708,My only insight on arranged marraiges is from indian matchmaking
6263,Hursh Karkhanis,1605656943621,oh my god dont get me started on that crap
6264,Hursh Karkhanis,1605657000099,TLDR: we cant be making shows like that on TV for people to watch bc then non-indians think all indians are like that
6265,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1605657031848,That is a stereotype not true in general
6266,Hursh Karkhanis,1605657042710,we need more good/cool indian things on TV like Hasan or Kal or Sundar or Satya or KAMALA and less of those drama shows with bad aunties
6267,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1605657103761,Also mindy kaling deserves some respect as one of the first Indian people in media that people actually know
6268,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1605657114805,Also she was a writer on the office so
6269,Hursh Karkhanis,1605657132805,bro my white roommate in college soph year was on the phone with his mom and he was telling her i was indian and she was like (oh does that mean he can only marry an indian??) and im 100% sure she got that from some show or movie similar to indian matchmaking
6270,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1605657168174,Or from her white friends who donât know a single Indian person
6271,Hursh Karkhanis,1605657220853,doesnt know a single indian person personally so her only image of india is some show or movie
6272,Hursh Karkhanis,1605657252185,Aziz should get HUGEEEE props for master of none expecially the one episode called 'indians on tv'
6273,Hursh Karkhanis,1605657387895,i think kal was the pioneer for aziz and hasan tbh
6274,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1605744736234,Iâve never been less excited for an nba draft since 2013
6275,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1605744755358,But then Giannis was that year so maybe gotta watch out

6280,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1605744875677,Feel so bad for him
6281,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1605744887955,Had to go to Cleveland
6282,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1605744904187,Should taken oladipo or Giannis
6283,Hursh Karkhanis,1605745121208,is obi toppin good
6284,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1605745132772,As a role player sure
6285,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1605745138256,As a franchise changer no
6286,Rishi Nair,1605745331188,He's 22 that's the main issue
6287,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1605745345903,Itâs more of a talent than age thing
6288,Rishi Nair,1605745349755,He can be a franchise changer just not much of a passer and not great on D
6289,Rishi Nair,1605745358968,He has all the talent
6290,Rishi Nair,1605745365286,Athleticism through the roof
6291,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1605745366177,Letâs c I guess
6292,Rishi Nair,1605745376200,He's kinda Blake esque as far as that
6293,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1605745384305,I heard the same thing about Derek Williams so Iâm not so positive
6294,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1605745394772,And Aaron Gordon
6295,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1605745401806,And a bunch of names

6710,Ameya Pandit,1606531551667,if they come out in heavy u come out in heavy too
6711,Hursh Karkhanis,1606531561578,"Nah I donât, I usually see whatâs working better man or zone and stick with it"
6712,Ameya Pandit,1606531567547,"heavy = more tight ends, running backs on the field"
6713,Hursh Karkhanis,1606531568416,And if it stops working I change

6717,Ameya Pandit,1606531594262,or like empty formations meaning just the qb behind the line
6718,Ameya Pandit,1606531600078,then come out in nickle/dime
6719,Ameya Pandit,1606531615733,dime basically means more fast athletes on the field who can cover
6720,Ameya Pandit,1606531624197,3-4 / 4-3 /goalline is the opposite
6721,Ameya Pandit,1606531628035,big guys who wanna stop the run

6894,Faizan Khan,1606954839483,Yeah thatâs the replacement for skura
6895,Faizan Khan,1606954982617,Although @Rishabh Swarnkar TJâs running mate on the other side got hurt and mightâve torn his ACL ð¢
6896,Faizan Khan,1606954985241,Bud Dupree
6897,Faizan Khan,1606954996150,So that might hurt his chances bc more attention on tj

6921,Alex Duong,1606957012114,bucs will prob be irrelevant again after 2021
6922,Ameya Pandit,1606957027674,Warriors will be lit this year

6929,Ameya Pandit,1606957503352,Povg3
6930,Ameya Pandit,1606957507930,Although heâs in a bad spot
6931,Rishabh Swarnkar,1606957529299,Cool
6932,Faizan Khan,1606957803750,Lmao it was also in baltimore off a bye for ravens
6933,Faizan Khan,1606957804881,Stop it
6934,Faizan Khan,1606957849180,But in theory yes they would be better if rematch bc of Bud
6935,Rishabh Swarnkar,1606958087563,Interesting
6936,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1606958396805,"Omg, Westbrook in DC"

6953,Rishi Nair,1606960421444,I think he's actually looking ok post injury
6954,Faizan Khan,1606960421969,Heâs always done well (but not amazing) on his own but idk if heâs the type to be able to work with another star and take it to the next level

7559,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608422001414,Jerry is in a league of his own
7560,Faizan Khan,1608422006297,only argument for randy over him would be that rice always played with elite qbs
7561,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608422032710,He was a lore explosive player but wasnât a better one
7562,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608422038499,Jerry won 4 titles

7570,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608422193870,They were both pass rushers but Lawrence did it as a linebacker and Reggie did it as a lineman
7571,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608422208804,Different systems tough to compare headings
7572,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608422217808,Head-on*
7573,Faizan Khan,1608422231763,close enough
7574,Faizan Khan,1608422246168,people compare strong safety and free safety like they're the same

7700,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608499821656,Thatâs how it works
7701,Hursh Karkhanis,1608499825727,You set the nickname for Faizan Khan to monday night football guy.
7702,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608499829442,Actually Buffalo
7703,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608499832431,But ok
7704,Hursh Karkhanis,1608499872783,fantasy football is kinda like the electoral college
7705,Alex Duong,1608499877127,buffalo and miami are gonna have bright futures
7706,Alex Duong,1608499882253,and the jets are getting lawrence
7707,Hursh Karkhanis,1608499890350,youre constantly looking for what other states you can get votes from

7713,Alex Duong,1608500763750,was good with cards last yr but really hasnt been that good this yr
7714,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608500805903,Heâs definitely overrated
7715,Faizan Khan,1608500807434,KC for like the next dominant team
7716,Hursh Karkhanis,1608500807952,yeah he's sucked
7717,Faizan Khan,1608500811627,Buffalo for division
7718,Hursh Karkhanis,1608500832501,drake is prob my most underperforming player
7719,Faizan Khan,1608500836072,But even then I donât think Buffalo gonna win the division every year
7720,Hursh Karkhanis,1608500931465,"i shoulda picked a reciever with my first pick, i stuck too closely with the ""pick an RB"" thing"
7721,Hursh Karkhanis,1608500950515,esp bc i was 8th so i didnt get any of the cream of the crop RB's
7722,Hursh Karkhanis,1608500970477,"and next pick after me was ameya and he picked Hopkins, a reciever"

7728,Hursh Karkhanis,1608501414994,mark ingram was another bad pick for me
7729,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608502335197,I couldnt open the draft at first my wifi wasnt working
7730,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608502340737,So it autodrafted MT
7731,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608502355759,I would've wanted to take derrick henry
7732,Cole Quinn,1608503747715,top 4 were all rough picks
7733,Hursh Karkhanis,1608503815124,"good game @Cole Quinn, im conceding already LOL"

7775,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608513517247,Pavithran Wojnarowski ð² sent an attachment.
7776,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608513535986,Matthew stafford is so underrated
7777,Alex Duong,1608513571031,needs to go to a real organization
7778,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608513579240,I guess
7779,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608513599844,"Heâs from the South, maybe the Saints?"
7780,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608513625217,They donât have a long term answer
7781,Alex Duong,1608513639553,maybe
7782,Faizan Khan,1608513732502,I think heâs properly rated
7783,Faizan Khan,1608513736336,Between top 10-15
7784,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608513745800,Thatâs fair
7785,Faizan Khan,1608513756403,He can take u to the playoffs if the team is good but not if theyâre bad
7786,Faizan Khan,1608513793753,Although if he had a better situation from the getgo heâd prob have developed into a star
7787,Faizan Khan,1608513800712,He had like superstar talent
7788,Hursh Karkhanis,1608513801888,No
7789,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608513809986,"Pavithran set his own nickname to It's not alright, alright, alrightð¤ð¾."
7790,Hursh Karkhanis,1608513809990,Yes to this
7791,Faizan Khan,1608513908872,A lot of people are saying Niners honestly Iâd rather just keep Jimmy if I were them
7792,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608513926855,Jimmy is solid no need for change
7793,Faizan Khan,1608513927733,Jimmyâs underrated at this point imo but issue is heâs glass
7794,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608513934822,Just get him more receivers
7795,Faizan Khan,1608513940922,Way too injury prone tho
7796,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608513961369,Stafford used to get hurt all the time too
7797,Faizan Khan,1608513962290,Deebo Aiyuk Kittle are fine
7798,Faizan Khan,1608513966787,Thatâs true
7799,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608513971106,Need more
7800,Faizan Khan,1608513976402,Eh
7801,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608513984013,Look at kc
7802,Faizan Khan,1608513985347,I think if anything get another back
7803,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608513992942,Jesus they are loaded
7804,Alex Duong,1608513993424,that offense is predicated on the run
7805,Alex Duong,1608513997452,i think theyre ok at wr
7806,Faizan Khan,1608514006752,Dude Mahomes makes kcâs wrs look much much better than they are
7807,Alex Duong,1608514007535,need a bell cow like chubb
7808,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608514017136,Would help
7809,Faizan Khan,1608514028400,Kelce and Hill were both nice but not this pre Mahomes
7810,Faizan Khan,1608514037466,Theyâre both gonna be first ballot hall of famers now lmao
7811,Faizan Khan,1608514054496,Watkins was a straight up bust
7812,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608514140322,I disagree he adds so much fear to that lineup
7813,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608514147927,When they wanna target him they can
7814,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608514154040,They usually donât have to
7815,Faizan Khan,1608514170298,No I meant he was a bust pre chiefs
7816,Hursh Karkhanis,1608514178541,You guys remember how we just changed Patrickâs team to my team bc he wasnât participating and I wanted in? We can do that for Arthur-Pavi
7817,Hursh Karkhanis,1608514183655,Or Goyal-Pavi
7818,Faizan Khan,1608514206556,And theyâre gonna do that with John Ross this offseason too Iâm calling it LOL
7819,Faizan Khan,1608514217241,Yee letâs check with them first
7820,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608514265424,He played for the Bills though
7821,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608514275909,Not really fair
7822,Alex Duong,1608514297140,with wrs where they end up kinda matters
7823,Alex Duong,1608514304193,he wasnt drafted into a great situation
7824,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608514331916,Whereas look at Justin Jefferson
7825,Alex Duong,1608514333680,but watkins was only ok with the rams
7826,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608514335606,Perfect match
7827,Faizan Khan,1608514393795,Yeah itâs the most dependent position in football
7828,Faizan Khan,1608514424618,Justin Jefferson was way more pro ready and has a great situation
7829,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608514447856,He went to a team that was close to his college team
7830,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608514457531,Was an easy transition
7831,Faizan Khan,1608514467819,Kirk is a top 10 qb however much people like to shit on him and Thielen is a top 10 wr to attract attention
7832,Faizan Khan,1608514471819,Yup
7833,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608514476255,Sammy werenât from Clemson to Buffalo

7836,Faizan Khan,1608514517361,Ya
7837,Faizan Khan,1608514524448,Who was even their qb at the time
7838,Alex Duong,1608514533124,tyrod?
7839,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608514540404,If we have to ask they weeent good
7840,Alex Duong,1608514543073,or ej manuel
7841,Faizan Khan,1608514695348,Nahhh he was way later
7842,Faizan Khan,1608514701187,He was Joe Flaccoâs backup back then
7843,Alex Duong,1608514705566,ah yes
7844,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608514716738,It was EJ Manuel
7845,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608514722928,From Florida State
7846,Faizan Khan,1608514749596,Idk he couldâve proved it on the Rams too
7847,Faizan Khan,1608514755808,He was like their 4th best wr
7848,Faizan Khan,1608514760861,Or 3rd
7849,Faizan Khan,1608514772982,But yes bad situation in the early years def makes an impact
7850,Hursh Karkhanis,1608515673245,Primetime football look so damn good like just the visuals
7851,Hursh Karkhanis,1608515693349,I also really like the browns jerseys
7852,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608515826258,did you just compliment teh browns
7853,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608515837338,i think thatâs the first time in recorded history theyâve gotten a compliment
7854,Alex Duong,1608515855153,theyre the #1 team in cleveland now
7855,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608515866614,also how many years over under before people say that the âbrownsâ is racist and they need to rename the team
7856,Alex Duong,1608515883967,their named after their founder
7857,Hursh Karkhanis,1608515884596,"aaandddd they just showed Yankee Stadium on the broadcast.

7863,Alex Duong,1608516093363,WFT old name actually came from a racist owner
7864,Alex Duong,1608516109194,so them getting the name change is pretty overdue
7865,Hursh Karkhanis,1608516110794,I mean
7866,Hursh Karkhanis,1608516120765,Wasnât everybody back then racist??

7868,Hursh Karkhanis,1608516166152,What do you think the Washington Football team name should be
7869,Alex Duong,1608516206783,warriors or redtails or something
7870,Hursh Karkhanis,1608516223684,ohhhhh retails would be awesome
7871,Hursh Karkhanis,1608516234256,Pay homage to the Tuskegee Airmen
7872,Hursh Karkhanis,1608516468592,"Iâm thinking 

Senators
Presidents
Sergeants
Admirals
Soldiers"
7873,Aditya Vishwakarma,1608516515135,redtails owuld be lit
7874,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608517365490,Senators would be cool. Then their defense would be top notch

7894,Ameya Pandit,1608598016414,"One on one without suits (like right out the shower): Batman without breaking a sweat

One on one with suits: iron man"
7895,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608598027975,If we use the premise that they fight with their original gear then yes. But we should take into effect that Batman fights dirty and would make the fight very interesting
7896,Ameya Pandit,1608598034398,My source is just the movies. Dk shit about comics
7897,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608598040021,OK then sure
7898,Ameya Pandit,1608598056759,yea thatâs cool and all but iron man has basically an indestructible suit
7899,Ameya Pandit,1608598060370,Weâre never going to agree
7900,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608598063342,But ur premise seems shortsighted because it doesn't account for all possibilities
7901,Ameya Pandit,1608598069529,And I donât wanna waste my time on make believe
7902,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608598075251,There u go
7903,Ameya Pandit,1608598080243,Is the conclusion I gathered
7904,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608598083710,U just won the fight
7905,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608598091545,Congrats and hats-off
7906,Ameya Pandit,1608598113410,I spent god knows how long talking to those two about Batmanâs impoverishment and them about iron manâs and we got no where
7907,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608598124664,Lol ameyas right
7908,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608598180792,Batman would lose 1 on 1 no question
7909,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608598278549,These what-if scenarios seldom lead anywhere
7910,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608598301253,They are both good guys who have more important shit to deal with than fighting one another
7911,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608598385758,They create discussion lol
7912,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608598397049,Its a good thing
7913,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608598422844,How does that conversation lead to anything though?
7914,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608598435118,If anything the two would team up not fight to the death
7915,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608598448699,Its about sharing opinions and backing them up
7916,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608598471625,"Yeah, but that doesn't happen a lot in today's world"
7917,Rishabh Swarnkar,1608598475103,Yes we have no idea what the end result would be bc its v unlikely but that doesn't matter
7918,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608598489105,"True, never though of it that way"
7919,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608598558256,Can we agree that some of these NBA contracts make no sense?
7920,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608598594753,"Jerami Grant, David Bertans, Markelle Fultz and on, vastly overpaid and are mostly doomed to fail"
7921,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608598677100,Even the Hawks keeping John collins without a long term contract and paying Gallinari 20 mill a year is absurd. They have to move collins
7922,Rishi Nair,1608598907148,Bertans u gotta pay for elite shooting lmao
7923,Rishi Nair,1608598922511,"Jerami small market gotta pay for a ""star"""
7924,Rishi Nair,1608598932870,Fultz has shown enough to get 50 over 3
7925,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608598933213,hes a backup lol
7926,Rishi Nair,1608599015650,Bertans?
7927,Rishi Nair,1608599019965,He might still start
7928,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608599024006,grant
7929,Rishi Nair,1608599037204,Grant is not a backup on the Detroit Pistons
7930,Rishi Nair,1608599044674,Detroit Poverty
7931,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608599066009,he's a power forward and now he's got blake griffin
7932,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608599079939,did he move to the small forward spot?
7933,Rishi Nair,1608599100817,He plays both forward spots and small ball C
7934,Rishi Nair,1608599127987,It's only looking like an overpay rn bc he's been cheeks in preseason
7935,Rishi Nair,1608599135833,But he could still be absolutely fine reg season
7936,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608599142753,he moved to the sf
7937,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608599146392,u right
7938,Rishi Nair,1608599180287,Think so
7939,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608599193598,"makes sense then, he was a pf for denver"
7940,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1608599204559,I guess they move around easily these days

8418,Rishi Nair,1610347271507,"idrk what to say this team just absolutely collapsed down the stretch and it was painful to see. offensively ben started showing his age suddenly and our oc was horribly predictable and offensive line dipped like crazy too. defensively, the collapse was less in our control we lost 3 of our 5 most important players so idk what you expect to happen i never claimed THIS defense was the best in football, the healthy one was and it showed it. take the points factor out of it and they played how they should- slightly above avg. this should be the end of big ben. 4 picks tonight mostly all his fault. almost all those points were off turnovers. just fucking sucks because the beginning of the season i saw the team i expected to see and it just went downhill from there. and going into this offseason we're almost guaranteed gonna get worse not better bc of all the free agents and salary cap hell. worst part is they actually teased us with a comeback and mike tomlin decided to punt like an idiot"

8509,Rishi Nair,1610557864822,Prob get Penei Sewell and like Jaylen Waddle in the draft
8510,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610557969855,Thatâs the best case scenario for them
8511,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610557988568,They should build around Tua not theyâre overachieving vets
8512,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558008469,If thatâs what they wanted they shoulda got Brady

8519,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558076569,Front 7 is overachieving
8520,Rishi Nair,1610558077747,3 they'll have Sewell on a platter
8521,Rishi Nair,1610558085545,Who's on their front 7 rn
8522,Rishi Nair,1610558091917,Wake gone isn't he
8523,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558097215,They should consider jamaar chase
8524,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558105242,Yeah
8525,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558112466,He left a while back
8526,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558121553,They donât have any young talent there
8527,Rishi Nair,1610558356710,JaMarr at 3 is too early
8528,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558374188,He might be worth it though
8529,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558383536,I see Michael Thomas in that dude
8530,Rishi Nair,1610558440844,I'd just trade up from their 2nd FRP
8531,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558478012,Whatâs going on with Micah Parsons ?
8532,Rishi Nair,1610558489793,Not sure how many slants Chase runs so can't comment
8533,Rishi Nair,1610558502000,Parsons prob first LB off the board
8534,Rishi Nair,1610558506932,Or the ND guy
8535,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558512409,He plays the rpo scheme well
8536,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558519269,Heâs worth it
8537,Rishi Nair,1610558568566,He's just an absolute super prospect
8538,Rishi Nair,1610558573716,Idt u take Devonta over him
8539,Rishi Nair,1610558589546,Devonta prob going Giants at 8
8540,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558594688,Really?
8541,Rishi Nair,1610558601955,Eagles should take Chase at 6
8542,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558603924,I have Zach Wilson there
8543,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558613060,To the giants
8544,Rishi Nair,1610558626496,Devonta could do for Jones what Diggs did for Allen
8545,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558637587,Maybe
8546,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558639300,He do
8547,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558648867,Does run routes well
8548,Rishi Nair,1610558650351,Although Allen is much more talented on paper
8549,Rishi Nair,1610558669341,And Giants have p much nobody that consistently gets open like that
8550,Rishi Nair,1610558688548,Shep and Slayton solid but they should go Devonta over Kyle Pitts
8551,Rishi Nair,1610558702837,If Pitts falls to Pats at 15
8552,Rishi Nair,1610558707704,That's a massive steal
8553,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558711980,Yes

8564,Rishi Nair,1610558835078,Also why tf is Zach Wilson going over Fields in every mock now
8565,Rishi Nair,1610558851921,Fields just dominated Clemson ik he had a bad game after that but how bad could it have been
8566,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558865898,It wasnât great
8567,Rishi Nair,1610558873334,Kyle Pitts at 5 to Bengals this mock is interesting af
8568,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558873529,He couldnât make plays at all
8569,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558887720,Watson tore this defense in pieces twice
8570,Rishi Nair,1610558906736,FIELDS AT 12
8571,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610558908804,Also Ohio State doesnât produce good QBs

8574,Rishi Nair,1610558934496,And 10 GMs would be on absolute glue
8575,Rishi Nair,1610558954147,Fields seems to be a way diff caliber than anybody they've had tho
8576,Rishi Nair,1610558957784,In history
8577,Rishi Nair,1610559068313,Wait they've had absolutely nobody lol I thought they had one at least decent guy like Sam Bradford or something
8578,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610559086816,Not really
8579,Rishi Nair,1610559094581,But he was OU
8580,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610559104695,No star at the next level
8581,Rishi Nair,1610559123630,This mock Pat's took Trey Lance at 15
8582,Rishi Nair,1610559142796,Rousseau went 14 to Vikes atp Raiders gotta trade up from 17
8583,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610559153930,These people are high
8584,Rishi Nair,1610559161491,W Kwity Paye and Jayson Oweh gone
8585,Rishi Nair,1610559192568,Yea they mocked some rando to us ð¤£
8586,Rishi Nair,1610559201437,And Mac Jones 19 to WFT
8587,Rishi Nair,1610559215676,Mac is at best 2nd round and even that's prob a massive reach
8588,Rishi Nair,1610559235356,I actually think he could be much better in the league but as a prospect I'm not taking him until at least 3rd or 4th
8589,Faizan Khan,1610575436730,Heâs 36 though and they wonât be contending before his prime is done better to move off
8590,Faizan Khan,1610575491227,Also Tua the concern is he might just be another mariota and theyâre never gonna get a pick this high the way the team is tending
8591,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610575512854,He played well enough to build around
8592,Faizan Khan,1610575515844,Tua just looked so....okay
8593,Faizan Khan,1610575524038,But yeah he could get better
8594,Alex Duong,1610575527193,he spent the whole offseason rehabbing
8595,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610575532152,Thereâs no garuntee a new guy would be better
8596,Alex Duong,1610575534951,this time he can actually train
8597,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610575541019,Tua was once a new guy 2
8598,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610575548475,Careful what u wish for
8599,Faizan Khan,1610575550310,Yeah but if u do have a chance to upgrade u should now bc ur not jobs have a top 3 pick ever again
8600,Faizan Khan,1610575556161,They need
8601,Faizan Khan,1610575561120,Pass rushers though
8602,Faizan Khan,1610575563810,Badly
8603,Faizan Khan,1610575571073,Then theyâre actually set
8604,Alex Duong,1610575642311,imagine if they still had minkah
8605,Alex Duong,1610575650128,idk they tried using him at SS like wtf
8606,Faizan Khan,1610575694595,Essentially LB
8607,Alex Duong,1610575696596,maybe they should try and sign bud dupree
8608,Faizan Khan,1610576419147,Minkah Byron Xavien would be LOB 2.0
8609,Faizan Khan,1610576445807,But hey one manâs trash is another manâs treasure
8610,Faizan Khan,1610576462149,And theyâre doing just fine otherwise
8611,Faizan Khan,1610576481928,Also I donât think theyâd take Peneii theyâre pretty set at tackle
8612,Alex Duong,1610576495173,they took tackle last yr
8613,Faizan Khan,1610576497643,Theyâd prob either take Jamarr/Devonta or trade back
8614,Alex Duong,1610576500957,idk if hes good tho
8615,Rishi Nair,1610576596327,They should've gotten a lot more in return
8616,Alex Duong,1610576611213,a first for an unproven db
8617,Faizan Khan,1610576633988,Yeah it was more than sufficient at the time
8618,Alex Duong,1610576637290,it worked out well for pittsburgh but that was considered a lot at the time
8619,Faizan Khan,1610576659044,Bc he looked like a bust bc of how they were using him
8620,Rishi Nair,1610576691634,Tru but his draft billing was high af
8621,Rishi Nair,1610576699671,I would've wanted like a 1st and a 3rd
8622,Rishi Nair,1610576719861,Can't do two first for a DB unless he's in prime and absolutely balling
8623,Rishi Nair,1610576725863,J Adams shit
8624,Faizan Khan,1610576829568,In hindsight seattle gave up way too much for Adams
8625,Faizan Khan,1610576833519,But letâs see more years
8626,Hursh Karkhanis,1610587117684,Browns gonna beat the chiefs
8627,Hursh Karkhanis,1610587121277,Donât hate
8628,Hursh Karkhanis,1610587128358,On my team
8629,Rishi Nair,1610587866408,I see you have gone to the Ameya school of bandwagoning one of Faizan's division rivals
8630,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610587995415,LMAO  why did i think this was dion waiters for a second
8631,Faizan Khan,1610588451285,But nah fr I doubt they beat the chiefs
8632,Faizan Khan,1610588480283,With all due respect to them they spanked our booties but that was wayyy more bad steelers than good browns
8633,Hursh Karkhanis,1610597130893,I just like their colors and their field and the fact that they are supposed to suck
8634,Hursh Karkhanis,1610597163743,KHAAAANUU
8635,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610681759198,pain
8636,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610681769212,hella good coach tho
8637,Rishi Nair,1610682183747,Bruh
8638,Rishi Nair,1610682189373,Jets caught a W
8639,Rishi Nair,1610682205856,I thought they let him go when he left the building post 2nd meeting w no deal
8640,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610682328603,Interesting
8641,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610682345581,I thought Eric beinemy was better fit
8642,Faizan Khan,1610682397766,bruh i read matt lafleur and was shocked
8643,Rishi Nair,1610682404300,Bienemy is just offensive Saleh
8644,Alex Duong,1610682419959,EB to chargers i think
8645,Rishi Nair,1610682427235,Pain
8646,Rishi Nair,1610682437439,They'd be lethal
8647,Faizan Khan,1610682440971,also saleh leaving is a big L for niners
8648,Faizan Khan,1610682465279,12-4 next season straight up
8649,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682497475,:(
8650,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682514361,last season really was peak for while
8651,Rishi Nair,1610682530029,Bums
8652,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682537451,we were jimmy g throwing the ball like 9 yards shorter to emanuel sanders catching that TD and winning the game
8653,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682547963,or at least going up
8654,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682550914,in 4th
8655,Faizan Khan,1610682556292,nah idts
8656,Faizan Khan,1610682562208,i still think yall will be really good next year
8657,Alex Duong,1610682571140,Jimmy is just glass
8658,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682572460,"hopefully, but jimmy g's injurejd like every other season"
8659,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682575700,literally
8660,Faizan Khan,1610682593270,they might move off him this offseason
8661,Alex Duong,1610682605287,I can see them trading up for
8662,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682605867,mullens s zn
8663,Alex Duong,1610682607666,Zach wilson
8664,Alex Duong,1610682611597,Or something
8665,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682624161,why can't we just draft the next tom brady
8666,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682627687,easy
8667,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610682639205,Yup

8669,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1610682657522,Do it right this time
8670,Faizan Khan,1610682661891,i really like jimmy tbh
8671,Faizan Khan,1610682664093,dude is just glass
8672,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682667735,drafted some italian mf over tom brady
8673,Alex Duong,1610682675619,Giovanni carmazzi
8674,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682677858,who never even played a game professionally i think
8675,Faizan Khan,1610682678249,he's like reliable when he plays
8676,Rishi Nair,1610682687952,I don't
8677,Rishi Nair,1610682693268,He's a worse DC
8678,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682697366,"yeah carmazzi, he sounds like he needs to own a pizzaria in new jersey not a nfl quarterback"
8679,Alex Duong,1610682701364,Every qb in that draft sucked lol
8680,Rishi Nair,1610682707548,I'm already not super hot on DC when he's not balling
8681,Alex Duong,1610682710019,Except chad pennington for a bit
8682,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682723964,yeah but 9ers litearally could have taken brady
8683,Rishi Nair,1610682724218,Bc these guys have to play perfect and not make mistakes otherwise ur fucked
8684,Faizan Khan,1610682731377,i mean jimmy isn't elite but for a middle of the pack guy i like him
8685,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682743819,"he was the hometown boi, was in the crowd endzone for the catch and everything"
8686,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682751162,he got carried by our run game
8687,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682757657,he's decent
8688,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682769220,not worth the big bucks we paid tho bc injuries
8689,Faizan Khan,1610682800042,i think you gotta be careful who you replace him with tho
8690,Faizan Khan,1610682803518,some mfs saying darnold
8691,Faizan Khan,1610682809276,crack cocaine
8692,Faizan Khan,1610682820159,even stafford i wouldn't
8693,Rishi Nair,1610682870463,Staff I would
8694,Rishi Nair,1610682876406,It's just age and injury issues
8695,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682888268,imagine not drafting this mf
8696,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682948067,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZofANQu74
8697,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682955863,"1:50 Tom Brady Sr. did ""i took it personally"" first"
8698,Aditya Vishwakarma,1610682957366,frrr
8699,Faizan Khan,1610682991803,Nah theyâre both middle of the pack Jimmy is younger and he was solid af last year
8700,Faizan Khan,1610683008134,I get he was carried by run game and D but he made big throws in multiple games crunch time
8701,Faizan Khan,1610683019393,Heâs like a game manger but one I would want
8702,Faizan Khan,1610683025120,But not a star
8703,Faizan Khan,1610683033148,Like Kemba Walker or something in basketball
8704,Rishi Nair,1610683218996,Never compare Jimmy
8705,Rishi Nair,1610683221716,To Kemba
8706,Rishi Nair,1610683224749,Ever again
8707,Rishi Nair,1610683243543,Jimmy isn't even Spencer Dinwiddie
8708,Faizan Khan,1610683297175,Tf
8709,Faizan Khan,1610683299666,Heâs solid bruh
8710,Faizan Khan,1610683323450,Thereâs a reason theyâre horrible w/o him and win with him
8711,Rishi Nair,1610683373525,That's also bc their backups are so bad
8712,Rishi Nair,1610683407780,He's just around solid
8713,Rishi Nair,1610683416206,Dinwiddie is nice better than solid
8714,Faizan Khan,1610683417575,17-8 with him and 7-19 without since he got there
8715,Rishi Nair,1610683419448,Good player
8716,Faizan Khan,1610683423126,Yeah
8717,Rishi Nair,1610683424281,And Kemba is a star
8718,Rishi Nair,1610683430886,Has made All NBA before
8719,Faizan Khan,1610683445888,But dinwiddieâs never been clear 1 so u canât rlly compare him to qbs
8720,Faizan Khan,1610683500711,Fine maybe someone worse than Kemba
8721,Faizan Khan,1610683575078,Upgrade him if you think the alternative can be a star
8722,Faizan Khan,1610683623301,Iâd take Jimmy over Goff
8723,Faizan Khan,1610683635576,Carr prob not yeah bc Carr has done it longer
8724,Faizan Khan,1610683673882,But Iâd also like to see Carr on a great team
8725,Faizan Khan,1610684094119,https://twitter.com/jjwatt/status/1349931096289517569?s=21
8726,Alex Duong,1610684116717,tf he was on their staff
8727,Faizan Khan,1610684153067,Guess so
8728,Faizan Khan,1610684167867,Thatâs pretty quick damn he was just playing now heâs a DC
8729,Rishi Nair,1610685458934,Also I'd take at least 2 to 3 players over Jimmy as best player on the team just like Dinwiddie but since he's qb he has more impact
8730,Rishi Nair,1610685489213,Kittle Bosa Ford etc are better Ford at least was idk about rn
8731,Rishi Nair,1610685494934,I'm also gay

8851,Sharan Chakravarathy,1611005743010,apt
8852,Sharan Chakravarathy,1611005800011,maybe it's just that he was banged up this year so ill give him a pass
8853,Sharan Chakravarathy,1611005818245,brees not being able to throw the ball more than 10 yards doesn't help either

8889,Rishi Nair,1611525106306,MJ 8 scoring titles and 1st team all defense in the same year

8917,Faizan Khan,1611555930107,Tom Brady is literally playing in it
8918,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611555961388,U just called him the goat and now ur calling him mediocre?
8919,Faizan Khan,1611556116743,Yes

8926,Faizan Khan,1611788184613,"Nobody is saying itâs the equivalent of MJ Bron in their primes, this would be like if MJ never stopped playing and faced Lebron in like 2005"
8927,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611788248799,Ur such a hater
8928,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611788264362,Brady had a good year ur acting like heâs washed up
8929,Faizan Khan,1611788272153,Tf
8930,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611788278438,Heâs not old Peyton Manning
8931,Faizan Khan,1611788284948,Iâm saying the exact opposite of that bro
8932,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611788291139,Oh
8933,Faizan Khan,1611788293355,Iâm disagreeing with Shannonâs take on it
8934,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611788314801,Heâs talking more about legacy than head to head irl
8935,Faizan Khan,1611788401718,The comparison is there bc itâs 2 goats from (shouldâve been) diff eras
8936,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611788416753,The whole argument is dumb if u ask me
8937,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611788428724,Itâs like nothing can beat Jordan
8938,Faizan Khan,1611788432461,Nathan Peterman > Old peyton Manning
8939,Faizan Khan,1611788504037,If Bron wins 2 more rings?
8940,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611788534161,Yes
8941,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611788544234,I meant that Jordan isnât invincible
8942,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611788557957,Magic was great during his time
8943,Faizan Khan,1611788570558,I agree we just havenât seen it yet
8944,Faizan Khan,1611788605727,Lebron still could letâs see
8945,Faizan Khan,1611788617691,Idt any other current guys could maybe Luka
8946,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611788630802,Tough to do that
8947,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611788648292,Giannis and Tatum have chances due to age
8948,Faizan Khan,1611788730983,Giannis no way
8949,Faizan Khan,1611788736400,Unless something drastically changes
8950,Faizan Khan,1611788771281,Tatum would have to pull off a dynasty and several scoring titles and mvps
8951,Faizan Khan,1611788794663,Ah yes @Shripad Bangaru is here
8952,Faizan Khan,1611788797459,Thoughts?
8953,Faizan Khan,1611788803764,On Tatum in the goat conversation?
8954,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611788824588,No
8955,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611788828952,Heâs not
8956,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611788837150,But he could
8957,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611788867286,Lot of time left in his career and heâs got Jaylen brown with him
8958,Rishi Nair,1611788939984,Jaylen Pippen
8959,Rishabh Swarnkar,1611790000924,@Faizan Khan stop hating
8960,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611801057399,Has anyone else heard the Black Panther 2 story?
8961,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611801062180,Crazy stuff
8962,Ameya Pandit,1611801075889,what story
8963,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611801095149,They might bring back Michael b Jordan
8964,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611801113442,His character might be redeemed and be the next panther
8965,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611801125703,but he died did he not
8966,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611801139887,It wasnât confirmed
8967,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611801140039,or are they gonna give him that magic plant thing
8968,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611801151225,Maybe tchalla saved him
8969,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611801151636,and i thought shuri was gonna be the next black panther
8970,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611801161570,Put him in cryostasis
8971,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611801162997,he died watching the sunset i thought
8972,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611801168116,hmm idk
8973,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611801178304,"i liked killmonger the was he was in the movie, good arc"
8974,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611801183368,We assumed that though
8975,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611801190939,That wasnât set in stone
8976,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611802766710,idk i think itâs kinda whatever to just make ppl think he died and then oh no heâs back!
8977,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611802773916,however if its a convincing redemption
8978,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611802791551,i think most ppl would look over how they brought him back
8979,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611802809737,just dear god dont do it like they did in the star wars sequels
8980,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611802915137,Those sequels were so unnecessary
8981,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611802917492,those are not canon to me tho so it doesnt matter
8982,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611802924882,yeah lool
8983,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611802945957,they coulda done georgeâs vision for the sequels but no they decided to do some fuckshit
8984,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611802959009,Heâs flowing in money
8985,Pavithran Konda Kumar,1611802963071,He canât bitch
8986,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611802973056,he can do both
8987,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611802977849,im on his side
8988,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611802986996,at least his would be original
8989,Faizan Khan,1611904217203,Holy disrespectful
8990,Faizan Khan,1611904219402,Wtaf
8991,Rishi Nair,1611904231891,Just in terms of situation I agree ish
8992,Rishi Nair,1611904235846,Even then it's different
8993,Rishi Nair,1611904245418,Wizards have drafted well it's just covid
8994,Rishi Nair,1611904253269,Texans sold everything
8995,Rishi Nair,1611904263859,Also impact wise Deshaun is a carry
8996,Faizan Khan,1611904411969,Beal could prob be Stafford or smth
8997,Rishi Nair,1611904447210,I think if u put Beal on a contender tho it's over
8998,Faizan Khan,1611904449326,Only thing is bad teams then maybe
8999,Rishi Nair,1611904459787,He can't guard me but he'd put up 40 a game
9000,Rishi Nair,1611904481095,Also Rishabh mentioned his defense might get better going to a contender
9001,Rishi Nair,1611904485005,Which is possible
9002,Rishi Nair,1611904499112,Clips/Bucks/Heat/Nuggs I'm down to see it
9003,Faizan Khan,1611904534449,Donât listen to Rishabh
9004,Faizan Khan,1611904541753,Heâs dumb
9005,Faizan Khan,1611904622059,But yeah any of those would be good
9006,Faizan Khan,1611904633155,Clips would be kind of a clunky fit
9007,Rishabh Swarnkar,1611904675544,I think its a motivation thing yea
9008,Rishi Nair,1611904686384,His defensive deficiencies would be covered up best w LAC
9009,Rishabh Swarnkar,1611904687620,Lebron didnt play defense on the lakers his first yr bc of same reason
9010,Rishabh Swarnkar,1611904694835,Celtics too
9011,Rishi Nair,1611904695545,Also he can play off ball
9012,Rishabh Swarnkar,1611904701656,Brad stevens
9013,Rishi Nair,1611904702300,Just give him the ball and it's a bucket
9014,Faizan Khan,1611904708667,Also when u donât have as much burden on offense u can develop defensively
9015,Rishi Nair,1611904713421,Fuck Celtikkks but yea
9016,Faizan Khan,1611904716440,KD on dubs etc
9017,Rishabh Swarnkar,1611904815465,Mhmm
9018,Rishabh Swarnkar,1611904819069,Lebron miami

9020,Faizan Khan,1611904860643,I donât wanna see this
9021,Rishabh Swarnkar,1611904869007,I feel like they can't get him without giving up pf
9022,Rishabh Swarnkar,1611904870788,Pg
9023,Faizan Khan,1611904881134,The narrative 100% would be âall that just to beat Lebron!â
9024,Faizan Khan,1611904889585,Just wanna see current Lakers clips
9025,Faizan Khan,1611904904543,Would need to give up like 7 picks lmao
9026,Faizan Khan,1611904927232,Heat is good Bucks is good Nuggets maybe
9027,Rishabh Swarnkar,1611904981721,He'd be good with the 6ers
9028,Rishabh Swarnkar,1611904983351,Your team

9047,Rishabh Swarnkar,1611905160381,You're talking about package

9052,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611905181928,from other teams or anything
9053,Rishi Nair,1611905427620,If I'm trading w Sixers I want Matisse
9054,Rishi Nair,1611905436578,Superstar potential on D
9055,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611905466795,i want matisse on lakers bruh he's a fuckin pickpocket
9056,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611905475622,kuz for matisse who says no
9057,Rishabh Swarnkar,1611905475875,Yeah him and Tobias would go
9058,Rishi Nair,1611905518299,He looks dope in Philly uni
9059,Rishabh Swarnkar,1611905522752,Kuz isn't getting traded anytime soon
9060,Rishabh Swarnkar,1611905523147,Lebron would've traded him by now
9061,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611905542702,rob
9062,Rishi Nair,1611905549776,His value isn't as rock bottom as it was a few months ago/last year
9063,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611905557042,kuz is actualyl solid when he gets minutes
9064,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611905562368,but he also is not solid bc he's inconsistent
9065,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611905578569,also does not know how to stop falling for fakes on defense
9066,Rishi Nair,1611905585724,Kuz to Wizards
9067,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611905608873,wizards would legit be half the 2018 lakers roster and pelicans would have the 2nd half

9072,Rishi Nair,1611905681319,I really wanna see Kostas fucking develop
9073,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611905685226,gasol is good but as a backup at this point
9074,Rishi Nair,1611905688558,Become a starter man you have all the tools
9075,Aditya Vishwakarma,1611905693695,he wont develop for us
