# Facebook Group Chat Metrics

## Introduction and Summary

Downloaded my Facebook Messenger data, cleaned and organized it with Pandas, and graphed it with Python and its visualization library MatplotLib, seaborn style. 

Graphs and printouts can be seen in the images folder, as well as below. 

### What hours of the day are most/least active?
![HOUR OF DAY]('/images/msg_by_hour_of_day.png')

### What percentage does each person contribute to the chat?
![SHARE PER USER]('/images/share_of_msg_per_user.png')

### Who messages more/less at which time of day?
![TIMESLOT 1]('/images/msg_by_timeslot_1.png')

![TIMESLOT 2]('/images/msg_by_timeslot_2.png')

### How have message totals for each user increased over time?

![TOTALS OVER TIME]('/images/msg_totals_over_time.png')


## Next Steps

I'd like to calsulate these metrics:

* median words per message for each user
* max number of messages sent in a row for each user
* median gap in time between messages from two different users (who replies to who fastest/slowest)
* most 'reacted to' users (by looking at message emoji reactions)
